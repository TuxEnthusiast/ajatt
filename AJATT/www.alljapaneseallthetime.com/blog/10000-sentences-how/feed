		<description><![CDATA[A lot of people have difficulty finding sources of sentences for 10000 sentences. I&#039;ve been using 10000 sentences to learn German, and it&#039;s very time consuming to manually enter all the data, so I have developed a tool which can help you to quickly find useful and interesting sentences for your chosen language using data from Tatoeba.

It&#039;s called TaToTen (Tatoeba to Ten Thousand sentences) and it helps you generate a sentence file rapidly (I add around 500 new sentences to my list in under an hour). When you have chosen your sentences, you can download the file to use with your favourite SRS tool.

You can try it out here : http://tatoten.com/

Please let me know if you find any bugs or have any feature requests!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES, my bad, I forgot about RTK. Although the information I provided should stil help. Keep in mind if you start RTK, keep studying grammar(or at least review what you learned), otherwise you&#039;ll just throw all that time down the drain(been there done that). Although that guy said to furthur study readings after RTK, I suggest to note the readings to the kanji you already know, and any you come by within context(in context is important, it makes the &quot;readingz&quot; easier to remember in most cases). Studying kanji alone by readings will make you burn out(depending how you study of course). I personally rememember readings only when they&#039;re used in senences/context, otherwise they fly out my head^_^ 

If you decide to do RTK, and as far as doing SRS setences after it, in order to review what you learned, you should probably go ahead and SRS that material while including any kanji you can(using a SRS method similar to mine, or something that works for you). NEVER limit yourself in life with anything. Just because you didn&#039;t do RTK, doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t learn jap and start SRS&#039;ing, that&#039;s just stupid. RTK is the easiest and best way to learn kanji yes, but it&#039;s not mandatory!

aynways, goodluck(:]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey!(:

I suggest you soak up as much Kanji as possible BUT it&#039;s also good to write them at the same time just to get used to writing kanji, etc! Looking at hiragana alone sholdn&#039;t be nessecary because the kanji you learn at a beg. level is very very easy to remember. Also looking at only hiragana alone could get confusing, HOWEVER, you also don&#039;t want to burn out by looking at a sentence full of kanji you don&#039;t know. Keep in mind your goal is to soak up as much kanji as possible, I can&#039;t stress how important kanji is to learn!!!

Here&#039;s an example from a sentence I made back during Genki 1,2. Insted of defining the kana right next to the word「この赤い(あかい)セーターは白い(しろい)のより高い(たかい)です。」 , which distracts me personally, I put numbers and list the kanji down below. So here&#039;s something you might want to try↓↓↓

[FRONT]
この*1赤いセーターは*2白いの####り*3高いです。 
1)赤い(あかい)
2)白い(しろい)
3)高い(たかい)

[BACK]
「よ」
この赤いセーターは白いのより高いです。 

So as you see, I lable each kanji with 1,2,3 etc then put all of that under the sentence. To me, this makes it pretty effiecent for me to find out what the word I&#039;m dealind with is. A more advanced form of that which I currently use for my own deck would be like so(it handles either small text, or entire story worth of text)

[FRONT]
この赤いセーターは白####のより高いです。 

[BACK]
「い」
しろ･い【白い】(1) Definition in japanese here/or english(for your case)
・・・
1)赤い(あかい)
2)白い(しろい)
3)高い(たかい)
・・・
この赤いセーターは白いのより高いです。 

Note how I use ・・・ as a divider, works great. Also this is sorta based off khantz idea, twisted to work for me. As you see I put ONLY the sentene on the front deck to test what I know, then I shove everything to the back. I don&#039;t always make MCDs, sometimes I just make sentences, so never limit yourself to what your sentence is, but at least have a foundation to make them quick so you can keep going on. 

Let me know if this helps or doesn&#039;t help, or I didn&#039;t answer any of your questions, etc(:]]></description>

Does this apply to people who are still in the beginner stages?

Does this step only apply to people who can already speak well?

Would it be a good idea to add the audio to the question side instead until you&#039;re comfortable speaking at a steady pace? You won&#039;t be learning Kanji readings from memory using that method though, so I&#039;m not sure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You read a lot, and you pick it up.  There *is* no &quot;exact&quot; answer, especially for stuff like わ, where the rules change depending on gender and dialect.  This is not low hanging fruit.  You should know what わ *means*, in a basic sense -- it&#039;s an emotional emphasis, and typically feminine -- but that&#039;s all you need for now.  Nuance comes from being completely swamped by Japanese, by a volume of Japanese that you might not be able to fully appreciate at this point.  You can figure nuance from context.  You will usually have to.  If you can&#039;t, it just means you don&#039;t yet have enough context.
 
I am nowhere near fluent, despite having read dozens of manga, 2000+ pages of Japanese novels, having played a Key visual novel almost to completion (the equivalent of another couple thousand pages), reading NHK news daily, learning Japanese rock songs on guitar (from tab notated in Japanese), and having listened to Japanese music and raw anime for a year and a half almost nonstop.  I am, at least, an order of magnitude away from fluent (more likely 3-4.) 
 
So, while I understand わ in the feminine usage (and to a lesser extent, the rather rare male usage), it&#039;s not from studying its meaning.  It&#039;s not from being magically &quot;fluent&quot; and everything suddenly making sense.  It&#039;s seeing it in context, a lot of *different* contexts: 「綺麗だわ」、「聞かなくても分かったわ」、「それは気の長い計画だわ」, etc (random excerpts from my SRS deck).
 
If you don&#039;t get the nuance yet, let it slide.  Once you have the rest of the pieces in place, the nuance will come in time.  This is something your brain is really good at.  Too good at, really, or puns and dirty jokes wouldn&#039;t be funny.  Focus on building a vocabulary and the necessary understanding of grammar, and then go read/listen/watch until you can look at a 200 page light novel and scoff at how thin and easy it is, until you&#039;ve read more written Japanese than the average high schooler, until you&#039;ve read as much in Japanese as you have in your native language.
 
Sorry for the long, somewhat condescending post, but really.  There&#039;s nothing magic about it.  It really is as simple as exposing yourself to as much Japanese as possible.  Stop worrying how it works, it does.  Just soak it up.  You don&#039;t need to know what water is made of to go for a swim.  ]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You read a lot, and you pick it up.  There *is* no &#8220;exact&#8221; answer, especially for stuff like わ, where the rules change depending on gender and dialect.  This is not low hanging fruit.  You should know what わ *means*, in a basic sense &#8212; it&#8217;s an emotional emphasis, and typically feminine &#8212; but that&#8217;s all you need for now.  Nuance comes from being completely swamped by Japanese, by a volume of Japanese that you might not be able to fully appreciate at this point.  You can figure nuance from context.  You will usually have to.  If you can&#8217;t, it just means you don&#8217;t yet have enough context.<br />

		<description><![CDATA[貴様 is quite easy but others are a real pain...
 
How do you know the use of わ (at the end of a sentence) ? I looked at the Yahoo!辞書 and there was no answer. I know this is grammar stuff but where to find the exact answer ? You can&#039;t quite figure it out even from context and 勝元 said that grammar isn&#039;t needed.
 
This is just an example but that&#039;s what I want to know : how to undestand fully this kind of little things which are always here. Some nuances are just lost in my reading and one can&#039;t learn what one can&#039;t understand. You was able to overcome it, 勝元 too. I haven&#039;t read all the blog entries but I don&#039;t remember having read someone talking about it. So, how did you do ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is why bilingual learning is *temporary* -- as soon as you have the vocabulary available to understand a dictionary definition, you switch to Japanese only.  Any nuances that you don&#039;t pick up from context, you&#039;ll pick up by reading the definition in Japanese.
 
(And, you know, if you&#039;re doing *anything* outside pre-packaged stuff, you&#039;ll pick up that 貴様 isn&#039;t exactly polite.  A good immersion environment should be correcting your mistakes constantly.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I got it wrong. I thought that without being sure of the meaning of the sentence was enough, it would fix itself with time. So I&#039;ve started with monolingual. 
 
... Well, at least I had the gist of them thanks to Rikaichan and some basics grammar.
 
質問 -&gt; You said to undestand every word. I&#039;ll quote you here, in MCD&#039;s examples, you put this sentence : You can’t handle the truth!” &#124; 貴様に真実など分かるか!. 
 
Japanese isn&#039;t as tasteless as your translation. Everyone translation in fact. So, how do you learn the nuance that aren&#039;t in the translation (貴様/など/か) ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey アミール.  Glad something I said finally helped someone somewhere.  That&#039;s probably a first.
Yeah, I&#039;m a big fan of the 10,000 sentences method.  As you mention, learning kanji in isolation is of limited value, since kanji often have quite a broad range of uses.  Seeing them in context is essential for understanding how they&#039;re used in a practical sense.  Now, anything I come across that seems useful or interesting gets entered as a sentence into Anki.  The whole SRS thing does have it&#039;s drawbacks, but I write about on my own site.  I would absolutely recommend going through Genki I and II, and taking sentences from those textbooks that you feel you need to review.  For me, I entered a bunch of example sentences for the transitive/intransitive verbs, and causative/passive-causative forms, which always strike me as kind of wacky.
I also like to write out sentences when I&#039;m reviewing them, not every sentence, but the ones that seem the most challenging.  
Keep up the good work!]]></description>
