		<description><![CDATA[Hi! I just read some of your articles and just wanted to say that I&#039;m really glad I finally found someone with whom I think I share all the thoughts about language learning acquisition. There is just so much BS out there... you know.
I&#039;ll probably end up reading all your articles these days.

Just wanted to say that for now. 
Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I’m sorry to contradict what you’re saying (not to be rude, but..) I’ve gotta put my two cents in here before someone gets hurt. &gt;.&lt;;&quot;

Natalie, believe me , no one is being hurt here. As you see, people are enjoying in their L2,L3 etc...

&quot;Ask any exchange student (or my now quad-lingual Sweedish friend): the best way to learn a language is to TALK.. You need to practice putting thoughts in your head into words. (not matter what the result is!) It is proof of what you are really retaining/can use on the fly.&quot;

So basically one can talk about things one doesn&#039;t know? Is there some kind of language source that we don&#039;t know (apart from the brain)?
Also, I am now in a foreign country and I am surrounded by exchange and foreign students, 99%of them were required to have at least intermediate knowledge of language (German) and then they were sent to special preparatory schools to reach C1 level in German. Four months, 5 days/week, 4h/day plus self learning.So you see, that is a lot of daily input. 

&quot;At the beginning of my stay in Japan, I tried the input-before-output method (I thought the same: If I can think things in Japanese, I will definitely be able to say them later!), and it failed miserably (MISERABLY!!!).&quot;

So you decided to come to this site to warn others, not to make your mistakes and it is possible to think in a foreign language and not being able to speak. That is something new. 
How much input did you put? 10 000 sentences. All Japanese All the Time?

 &quot;I only began becoming fluent when I made daily efforts to produce sentences and messages. So what if my grammar was a little off?&quot;

So what is the difference between your method and AJATT? 10 000 sentences, most of them written also with the hand.

 &quot;I was always monitoring what I was hearing and saying, and listening to how native speakers word their sentences and use certain words. It didn’t take longer than a week for me to be able to fix a mistake I had been making for the past few months.&quot;

Again , explained several times on this site , how to imitate Native speaker. 

I don’t speak English perfectly some of the time (everyone makes mistakes; even after being immersed in perfect English nearly my entire life), and I speak Japanese perfectly much less than that; but the point is I am making an effort and in turn making an improvement.

Everyone is making effort. The difference is that with AJATT you don&#039;t feel psychologically abused compared to regular classes, grammar drills, output pressure etc... You feel happy and in turn make better progress than &quot;monitoring&quot; obsessed individuals.]]></description>

Actually, every single person I&#039;ve ever asked who&#039;s learned to speak my L1 (English) fluently has told me they&#039;ve learned it from watching lots of TV.  :-)

The one downside I see is the occasional awkward moment.  I was trying to read a Japanese book in a coffee shop recently, and some random guy comes up and asks (in Japanese) if I&#039;m studying Japanese.  I understood everything he said *perfectly*, but didn&#039;t know how to answer!  I stood there and nodded my head like an idiot.  「uh, はい？」]]></description>

Ask any exchange student (or my now quad-lingual Sweedish friend): &lt;b&gt;the best way to learn a language is to TALK&lt;/b&gt;.. You &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to practice putting thoughts in your head into words. (not matter what the result is!) It is proof of what you are really retaining/can use on the fly.

ps. I learned the kana before the kanji, and I wouldn&#039;t have had it any other way. There will always be more kanji to learn, but being able to write in kana is a giant step towards being able to fully immerse yourself in Japanese. (being able to write the words you don&#039;t know)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, I just checked your FAQs (this time a bit more thoroughly... aka reading the very first one).

Hey, I don’t know the kanji yet, but I have this question about sentences…
STOP. Learn the kanji first. Kanji first. KANJI FIRST. KANJI FIRRRRRRST!!!!!! I’m not even talking to you any more until you learn the kanji. Go…No, go. Go, and come back when you know them. Listen to and read (look at) as much Japanese as you want, but don’t do sentences until yer dun with ye kanjees.

Point taken. I&#039;m at 200 now, so it&#039;s just a matter of time :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Khatz, I&#039;ve only learned the kana, and I&#039;ve got my first few dozen kanji down (and of course, Japanese environment is currently engaged). But I&#039;m just thinking forward to when I start sentence picking. For someone just starting, I&#039;ll be going from Japanese to English. I&#039;m still not sure where to find these sentences though. 

Where do you find a good bilingual source for sentences? I saw you recommended a Japanese-English dictionary, but won&#039;t that just have translations of individual words? I can&#039;t really get them from my music, as the romaji lyrics are everywhere, but there&#039;s none with Japanese script. and I take it, for a beginner, converting romaji into Japanese script would be a bit crap? Same goes for anime, apart from where you posted the script to GitS, which I will devour :D

And, if I were to get the sentences from some source other than audio/video, would it not be dangerous to go around pronouncing it, without hearing a native speaker say it? I don&#039;t have a native Japanese speaker to check all the sentences I&#039;d need to input, so what&#039;s the best course to chart?

Also, for  a beginner, I take it running through an anime series with subs on is OK, then rewatching without subs? 

Cheers for any help! And thanks for making the site, it&#039;s complete win.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been listening to Japanese songs for a long time, and picked up a few phrases here and there.
I haven&#039;t remembered all the kanji yet, so don&#039;t kill me!
But it just came, naturally, just like you said. I listened, and it came to me. Now when I listen to songs, I can point out a few words/phrases. It&#039;s a small amount, but a good beginning I guess.

I&#039;ve actually learned how to speak all the Japanese I know from watching Japanese shows and listening to Japanese music.]]></description>
