Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In short, yes, you will get what words mean.

That and constant exposure to native material.

I think the reason why people are bitter towards Khatz about his zero grammar approach is that they have the idea drummed into them that language learning is a series of rules that you have to follow from the wider society of killjoys known as traditional language teachers. They seem to forget the way that kids learn languages, through experiencing them in context. You can completely ignore the grammar books because you don&#039;t need them. With MCDs, you start linking different grammatical structures to contexts which become familiar to you through SRS. Like if the context is about how you spent your day yesterday, you might come across a grammatical structure involving the word &#039;play&#039;. (e.g. I played, which is in the past tense). You might look up the word in the dictionary to find the infinitive (to play). The point of that is to get the basic sense of the word. The different grammatical nuances are inferred through context (if the context mentions the word &#039;yesterday&#039; for instance, that might give you a clue to the fact that the &#039;playing&#039; occurred in the past, when you see the same sort of pattern in different places and you notice there&#039;s a similar context involving times before the present, you&#039;d be tempted to think that perhaps this isn&#039;t a coincidence). As you add more and more cards, earlier cards become clearer. And the good thing with the MCD approach is that you say the word out loud. That gets you used to saying the correct thing in the context. Once I realized this, MCDs have become so much more clearer and so much more fun.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It makes totally sense. I&#039;m actually starting to use this method for Spanish,and i have noticed improvements.

But just for clarification, finding sentences aren&#039;t that hard, just hit up some news website or forum, but should I be sentence mining for sentences with translations in L1(in my case english)? Or should I gathering L2 sentences, and just makes cards while cloze-deleting words I don&#039;t know but will eventually learn (since it is in context)?

I guess what I am asking is should I be looking up every word I dont know or based on this method, through constant SRS reps I will just GET what words mean?

BTW i use a grammar book so translations are already there, I just want to see if I would be able to move past the grammar book to L2 media and learn combined with the MCD method.]]></description>

I know I look like Michelangelo’s David, okay? Wait…pull back. But you know what? Even I’m not perfect.&quot;  As a fellow blogger in a completely different niche (parenting) I so hear you and I wish I could use this answer sometimes. It wouldn&#039;t fly for me, but that really made me laugh, thank you.

Ok - off to continue reading about acronyms language learning and whatnot.  You&#039;ve really helped me in my German learning; I&#039;m so curious to read more about what you&#039;re doing now.

Thanks again!

Not just, &quot;MCD is short for Massive-Context Cloze Deletions&quot;.  I wanna know what Massive-Context Cloze Deletions ARE. How they WORK... D:

I don&#039;t wanna buy something without knowing first what it is. It&#039;s like going to the Trading Cards section, closing my eyes, and picking out a pack of cards and then buying them without looking to see if they&#039;re the kind of cards I actually collect... Okay, not the best example, but I&#039;m sure you get it.

For you, Khatz, I actually might buy it anyway just because I trust you to be the eyes of the blind (in the sense of being blind toward what&#039;s good for your language learning) in these situations. But I&#039;d rather not rely merely on trust when spending my rarely-earned money. (I&#039;m mentally too young for a real job, and only have a tiny &quot;career&quot; which is barely getting me anywhere because it hasn&#039;t truly started yet.)

I&#039;ll look it up and come back to you, though. :) Hopefully I&#039;ll find something.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, 
 
I&#039;m the handsome Santayana, the man who gave rise, a long time ago, to the celebrated post by Khatzumoto titled &quot;How to Be a Capablanca,&quot; or something like that. By the way, I would love to insert a reply to that post sometime. I think I probably have some interesting things to say on that topic.
 
At any rate, I&#039;m not a learner of Japanese, the only foreign language I study being English. Yes, I only dabble in English as a Second Language, Since I employ exclusively Krashen-influenced learning strategies, I&#039;ve been following AJATT rather devoutedly over the years. This website is full of nuggets of gold on the Krashenite approach to foreign language acquiring. I have never registered to the &quot;Plus&quot; version of AJATT though, and that&#039;s because, well, its galore of resources are designed for Japanese language learners, and I&#039;m just not one. 
 
I don&#039;t think I&#039;m the only learner of a language other than Japanese that keeps an eye on AJATT. Alas, I believe the non-Japanese-learning readership of AJATT make up for a remarkable, if minor, part of the whole readership of the website. 
 
So... Any chance that Mighty Khatz explains what MCDs are in a decently detailed fashionto people like me, i.e. people that for understandable reasons have not upgrading to the commercial area of this website? What about a small demonstration of how a few MCDs items, let&#039;s say a dozen of them, would read if the language at hand was English?
 
Unleash the Krashen!

		<description><![CDATA[When I first started with sentences I was pretty overwhelmed and missed most of the readings for the kanji since I literally didn&#039;t know any words before this point. I tried vanilla sentences and was getting discouraged because of how often I would fail them during reviews. I then gave MicroMCDs a try and the amount of cards I failed went down dramatically. What I did for my JE sentences was: Japanese and English on the front, and close out one part of the Japanese sentence (word, particle, kanji) and then grade myself based solely on whether or not I could, and at what difficulty I could, produce what was in the clozed text and if I knew its reading. Since they&#039;re just one sentence per card, I would always read the whole sentence, but even if I didn&#039;t understand parts of it not in the cloze, I still wouldn&#039;t score myself based on that.
As for being able to speak it, I don&#039;t factor that in my grading, but I often read out my cards if I have a desire to, but honestly I think that my immersion environment has done more for making my speaking sound better than actively working to improve it. (I&#039;m not too far along, so it still isn&#039;t great)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m pretty sold on this technique, but I get the impression that it would be rather overwhelming to the newbie. For someone just finishing up RTK1 and ready to move into sentences, what would be the recommended course of action? Pure MCD, perhaps starting with the micro variety? Sentences then MCD? A mix of both from the start? I can see MCDs being incredible once you go monolingual, but anything leading up to that seems difficult to come up with a gameplan for me.
Also, how would you score yourself on MCDs? Unlike sentences (which have an easy clear checklist of things for a perfect score) it doesn&#039;t seem all that straightforward. Would it be based on speed of recognition? Recognition of a number of properties of the word (reading, function/meanings, etc.)? Recognition of the word combined with the ability to read the whole card? Does the ability to speak it aloud factor into the score like sentences, or should I entrust the development of that entirely to language exchange services/strategies? Just some things I&#039;m wondering.
My best guess at a beginner&#039;s approach would be to use sentences as usual, and at the same time use MicroMCDs to reinforce vocabulary and specific grammar points, then just go straight MCD when you decide to go monolingual. However I am very interested to hear what other people have done in the same situation and to what degrees of success.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a questions I just started sentences today and I just found out about MCD and I am not sure how the work? Since I am a beginner Should i say with sentences for a while or start fresh with MCD and can someone give me some easier examples I am still very confused. Thanks in advance.]]></description>
