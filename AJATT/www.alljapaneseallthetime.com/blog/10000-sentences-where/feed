		<description><![CDATA[For exposure purposes (immersion); you must avoid the subs and translations even if you are clueless as to what they are saying you will understand them anyhow since you are getting visual cues; therefore if you are a complete beginner- watch purely movies for exposure- take a pass on written literature for now- you will probably learn the grammars and understand some of those soon enough - but let me ask you this (if you are not a native english speaker) you used to enjoy english cartoons as a kid althogh you probably don&#039;t understand around 80% of the words! But you get better because you never cared! Do that with stuff in your target language! just watch/read them even if you dont understand everything just enjoy everything you can enjoy about it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[¡ESTUPENDO! By the way where I came from- jap anime is very popular. You could get a complete series of DVD bluray imitation of any anime you want from Dragon ball, cooking master, Boy, Naruto, Bleach, Lucky Samurai X, Lucky Star, You name it! Each for less than a buck if you convert the currency- you might say I am better off learning Japanese instead since some of those like YUYU hakusho, Slam dunk, and Hajime no Ippo I have already watched in our native language version (on local TV) for like TEN times!
Right now I am actually watching them in Spanish version – too bad there aren’t any pirated Spanish DVDs here – I had to download them on youtube. 
But Katz-what is your take on using Animes for Exposure in language learning? I know you’re into manga but what about Animes?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m currently learning Kanji and after reading this post it got me thinking.
Wouldn&#039;t Visual Novels be perfect for this purpose?
Most Visual Novels are voiced and written, and you can go easily 20-30 hours with one.
Fate/Stay Night for example. It took me over 100h to play everything and I&#039;m thinking of replaying it after I&#039;m done with the Kanji because I only played it with an translation patch. But those old and VN&#039;s are pretty pricey. I got lucky and got a really good copy for 70$ from ebay 4 years ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Khatzumoto, I am looking for sentences, but I cannot read a good amount of them.
So my question is, how much kanji should I learn before looking up sentences and how would I understand the sentences?
I already know Hiragana and Katakana, so I can sound out most sentences but cannot understand them, how do you suppose I understand them? Should I learn more first in terms of listening ? Should I use a dictionary with english to find the sentence meanings? What is a good Idea to do while picking out sentences in terms of finding their meanings?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A note about operating systems in Japanese. If you are a linux user, most linux distributions offer the option of changing the systems locale even after installation, which changes, things like the menu bar, options/error dialog, and such in X applications. While you may change the system&#039;s locale globally,it&#039;s a better idea to make the change locally to ensure that other users&#039; interface will remain the same.

In order to change a user&#039;s locale you must first enable the locale. Please refer to your distribution&#039;s documentation about how to do this. The next step is distrbution agnostic. Simply add the following line to your .bashrc or .bashprofile
export LANG=foo
where &quot;foo&quot; is the name of your locale (mine is jp＿JP.utf8 so my line is export LANG=jp＿JP.utf8).
Once you do this simple log in and out and VIOLA! Your X applications are now in Japanese

Please note that changing your locale will not change the language of an application if it was not compiled with/or does not support UTF8/Japanese fonts]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Khatzumoto mentioned WWWJDIC example sentences in his post and someone mentioned http://tatoeba.org in the comments above... 

You have to know that since December 2009, Tatoeba became the new place where WWWJDIC example sentences are maintained. The whole adding/correcing sentences process now takes place over there, with the benediction of Jim Breen of course. Sentences in WWWJDIC are a subset of the sentences in Tatoeba. Subset because Tatoeba is also extending the sentences collection to other languages, so there&#039;s more than just English and Japanese.

I can only encourage you to drop by and contribute, because it&#039;s a Wikipedia kind of thing, anyone can contribute. And we are distributing the sentences under the Creative Commons Attribution license (CC-BY).

(Disclaimer: I&#039;m the author of the project)

It is still true that NOT 100% of the sentences are reliable, but now they are open to everyone, and everyone can improve them. And hopefully someday, we&#039;ll end up with a resource that can be 100% trusted. That&#039;s at least what we&#039;re aiming for.

Even though, right now, the system is not perfect... But there&#039;s enough to get things done. For instance, one user created a list of English sentences he felt had mistakes (http://tatoeba.org/eng/sentences_lists/edit/29). If you&#039;re an English speaker, you can check this list, and correct the sentences if they are indeed not correct. 

This is something you could do for Japanese as well, if you&#039;re a Japanese learner. You can create a list for Japanese sentences that needs to be checked, and whenever you find sentences that sound weird to you, you add it to the list. And drag your Japanese friends/penpals along, because Tatoeba still doesn&#039;t have a lot of Japanese speakers hanging around, and we really them.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Khatzumoto mentioned WWWJDIC example sentences in his post and someone mentioned <a href="http://tatoeba.org" rel="nofollow">tatoeba.org</a> in the comments above&#8230; </p>
<p>You have to know that since December 2009, Tatoeba became the new place where WWWJDIC example sentences are maintained. The whole adding/correcing sentences process now takes place over there, with the benediction of Jim Breen of course. Sentences in WWWJDIC are a subset of the sentences in Tatoeba. Subset because Tatoeba is also extending the sentences collection to other languages, so there&#8217;s more than just English and Japanese.</p>
<p>I can only encourage you to drop by and contribute, because it&#8217;s a Wikipedia kind of thing, anyone can contribute. And we are distributing the sentences under the Creative Commons Attribution license (CC-BY).</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: I&#8217;m the author of the project)</p>
<p>It is still true that NOT 100% of the sentences are reliable, but now they are open to everyone, and everyone can improve them. And hopefully someday, we&#8217;ll end up with a resource that can be 100% trusted. That&#8217;s at least what we&#8217;re aiming for.</p>
<p>Even though, right now, the system is not perfect&#8230; But there&#8217;s enough to get things done. For instance, one user created a list of English sentences he felt had mistakes (<a href="http://tatoeba.org/eng/sentences_lists/edit/29" rel="nofollow">tatoeba.org/eng/sentences_lists/edit/29</a>). If you&#8217;re an English speaker, you can check this list, and correct the sentences if they are indeed not correct. </p>
<p>This is something you could do for Japanese as well, if you&#8217;re a Japanese learner. You can create a list for Japanese sentences that needs to be checked, and whenever you find sentences that sound weird to you, you add it to the list. And drag your Japanese friends/penpals along, because Tatoeba still doesn&#8217;t have a lot of Japanese speakers hanging around, and we really them.</p>
