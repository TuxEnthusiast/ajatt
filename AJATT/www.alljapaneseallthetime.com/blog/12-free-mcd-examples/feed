		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m able to gather a fair bit from these, but it is quite hard to follow when my L2 is not Japanese!

The bilingual is easy to follow, but I&#039;m not so clear on the tranny cards. I think I&#039;m being confused by the multiple cloze deletions. Here is what I think I&#039;m looking at in the 4 tranny examples.

1. (Part of?) a known word is clozed. A definition and 2 example sentences follow, in which the word is clozed again. On the back, the answer to the cloze is given in bold, followed by the unclozed text. A translation of the cloze to english is also given

2. A word and its definition are given. A word that recurs in the definition is clozed twice (the word is unclozed). On the bacn, the answer to the cloze is given in bold, follwoed by the unclozed text. A translation is given for the word as well as for varying related words.

3&amp;4. Same as 1

And can&#039;t make much out for the monolingual ones. 

Am I at all in the right area?

Thanks to anyone who can help clear this up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] The next step is to block out various unfamiliar parts of the text. Sometimes I block out the transliteration of the hieroglyphs; sometimes I block out half a word on both the hieroglyph and transliteration lines. Basically, I want these occlusions to be ridiculously easy. I&#8217;ve found that easy Anki cards work just as well as hard ones, and I can review them a lot quicker, and with a lot more pleasure, so why not?

		<description><![CDATA[Splitting Hanzi compounds into separate cards seriously screwed everything up for my Mandarin.

1) When reading, I&#039;d fail to recognise words I&#039;d reviewed, because split cards had trained me to view them separately. Eg 成果 wouldn&#039;t seem like a word in it&#039;s native environment, and I&#039;d 

a) subvocalise it as &quot;chéng guǒ&quot; rather than &quot;chéngguǒ&quot;.
b) understand it as something more like &quot;become fruit&quot; than &quot;result&quot;.

2) SRS scheduling got mangled by &quot;false passes&quot;. Eg upon hitting 名######## I should have written 子, failed, and studied 名字 from the beginning, lesson learned. But as it happened, I met the card ########字 just beforehand, and &quot;passed&quot; with 字, sending my 名######## way off into the future, unremedied. Any attempt to cleverly counteract this with ease buttons just lead to agonisation and slowed me down.

3) When outputting, I&#039;d constantly not know whether to produce 成果 or 果成.

4) When choosing between multiple possible readings, isolated characters are more likely to be screwed up. Eg, when only clozing the 為 in 為了 為什麼 I&#039;d falsely generalise and keep reading 以為 as yǐwèi. the distinction between the two was becoming fuzzied by not treating words as what they are, words.

Clozing words instead of parts of words has eliminated all 4 of the above problems, and I&#039;m not going back!

My failure rate on SRS has increased by about 5-10% from what it previously was. But that&#039;s not a bad thing, it&#039;s a genuine reflection of my level. And more important, failing on Anki isn&#039;t bad, it&#039;s learning, and keeping it artificially low is just self-delusion. Seriously, WTF use is half a word?

Meanwhile, genuine IRL screw-ups as described above are going DOWN.

TL;DR Clozing compounds one Kanji at a time &gt;&gt;&gt; weak. Clozing words as words &gt;&gt;&gt; strong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Could you please provide us with example MCDs for some of the more commonly taught languages? Are these MCDs pre-packaged sentences or do users create their own content? Or both? &quot;instead of having 1 card with 9 unknowns, you have 9 cards with 1 unknown each&quot; I like the concept of learning from context but I&#039;d like to understand your approach better. 

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m still a little skeptical.  It seems reasonable using short question and answers would enable a person to learn more vocabulary in the same amount of time.  I could see, however, how MCDs could help with learning to read longer passages, similar to incremental reading.

But if you say they&#039;re better than short reps, I&#039;d give it a go.  So, are they better?  And how many MCD reps do you typically do a day?]]></description>
