		<description><![CDATA[I was just thinking that I&#039;ve really been negleting ajatt and my immersion lately... But then I realised, the TV&#039;s on and it&#039;s in Japanese, I&#039;ve just been at work for 10 hours and my collegues and kids mostly speak to me in Japanese, when I drive to and from work the radio is only in Japanese, when I have spare time between classes I study Japanese, if I want to do or get ANYTHING it has to be through Japanese (oh and gestures! Never underestimate the power or gestures XD).. it&#039;s so easy to learn living in the country of your target language! It used to always have to be an active thing for me to be in an immersion environment.
Although, I must say, I have met people who have been here for YEARS and they know noooothing! You can really isolate yourself in a bubble wherever you live ;P Ganbare, minna!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The one and only time I&#039;d ever write individual words (I&#039;d never enter a word on its own into the SRS; language doesn&#039;t work in terms of self-sufficient &quot;words&quot;) is if I&#039;m doing what Khatz describes, by just making up little notes while in a class or whatever. This works great with nouns, verbs and small, simple sentences: you get the benefit of:

a) writing practice,
b) immersion, and
c) more associative incidents (i.e. if you&#039;re learning about cell walls and you write &quot;wall&quot; next to the cell wall diagram, bam: you just got a fresh associative incident) ...

... all without instilling bad grammar into yer brain or making up Japlish. I didn&#039;t do this often since it works best for Japanese (I&#039;m learning a Semitic language) and I haven&#039;t been to school in years, but it&#039;s great for any idle time really.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That reads like I live. I have the same routine at the moment.

I want to thank you for this comment:

&quot;I planned my tools and environments.&quot;

That made me think quite a lot about what I can do now, as I have been considering it a lot right now. 

After reading again, I am going to try to do more writing of notes, etc. in Japanese. Thanks for the help!]]></description>

Hmm, interesting.  Maybe the site should be &quot;get_mercilessly_corrected_by_native_speakers.com&quot;  Lang-8 is similar to this, but I think not quite the same as being corrected by a live human.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that Khatz 10,000 hours in 18 months was a bit of an estimate, and this number has also been rounded a couple times, but I&#039;ve done the math and if you want to get exactly 10,000 hours in 18 months, you can have 4 and a half hours a day for non-Japanese moments. 

I&#039;ve now built my Japanese environment, now I&#039;m trying to optimize it. Like, I may have Japanese audio on and working on RTK right now, but I&#039;ve also got a hockey game on TV (with the sound off) and I&#039;m typing to this in English... :/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lol. I agree with some of the others, its actually a lot less hardcore than I imagined. But practical and logical.
I&#039;m doing most of those things except the SRS reps~ Trying my best but with med school finals 4 months away its hard to add cards to the deck~! :p 
and taking notes in the &quot;kanji-kana hybrid shorthand&quot;??! i love doing that! I write it instead of the english word so even when I&#039;m studying for class, I&#039;m actually studying Japanese! ^^]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But what time was the hookers and blow?

In all seriousness, you should&#039;ve posted this years ago! I agree that when it&#039;s laid out like this it seems much more simple and doable for us mere mortals. We can see that you were a normal guy with a life, job, friends, and, err... frisbees :) I know you&#039;ve said as much before, but even so, it&#039;s kind of hard not to envision &quot;hardcore Khatz&quot; as an ascetic Japanese devotee who willingly cut himself off from the rest of the world to go on a studying binge... or something. Or failing that, &lt;i&gt;at least&lt;/i&gt; one of those magical beings who somehow seem to have more time than everyone else :)  But reading this schedule, I just see a really enthusiastic guy who gets that one song and one SRS rep in wherever he can.

In fact, the only part of your schedule that seems really hardcore to me (but maybe this is because I&#039;ve been reading common sense for too long now to be shocked by it?) is taking notes in class in a &quot;kanji-kana hybrid shorthand&quot;. But this taken by itself (instead of as one aspect of the Insanely Hardcore Japanese Bootcamp regimen I think many people were imagining) seems like nothing more than a fun challenge :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, this is a lot less hardcore than I thought it would be... makes it seem a lot more doable (if I remember to charge my MP3 player since I always forget). And you&#039;d listen to the news while sleeping? I listen to music because anything else is just... too strange for me. But listening to music makes me have strange dreams about singing said Japanese music... it&#039;s very strange. Perhaps I&#039;ll try something more monotonous, but then I might start having weird dreams about the news! There is no escaping Japanese once you start it with this method, is there? :)

Also, the thing about carrying around a Japanese book sparking a conversation about Japanese, I kind of know how that is. I carry around printed sheets of Japanese with furigana to read when I&#039;m bored of English (which happens quite often :D). Whenever someone sees it, they always say &quot;You know Chinese?&quot;, then while raging at them inside for saying the wrong language, I politely correct them. Then they find no problem with it and say &quot;You know &lt;i&gt;Japanese&lt;/i&gt;?&quot; which I have to so &#039;no&#039; to, since most of what I&#039;m reading I don&#039;t understand a lick of. But it&#039;s still fun somehow... I can&#039;t quite figure out why either. Anyway, the conversation always seems to end there... I wonder if they&#039;re thinking &#039;then why are you carrying around something you can&#039;t understand&#039; or if they perhaps think I&#039;m just being modest. People are funny that way I guess.]]></description>
