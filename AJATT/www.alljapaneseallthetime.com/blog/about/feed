		<description><![CDATA[Omg. I used to think that I studied Korean a lot. I can go for like 5-8 hours a day. You have me MEGA beat. I&#039;m trying to understand where you got that amount of time to dedicate to studying. Are your days longer? Do you somehow harness the 36 hour day? Lol, just kidding. Good on you. I hope that I can become fluent in Korean within the next year. Especially since it took you just over a year(?) to develop ridiculously high fluency.
