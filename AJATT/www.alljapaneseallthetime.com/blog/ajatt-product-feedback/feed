		<description><![CDATA[Hm, not sure if my comments to the above form went through or not, so here they are again.  Anyway, although the + has been pretty quiet of late I&#039;ve been enjoying what there is, not to mention I&#039;m sure there are gems in the archives I&#039;ve yet to discover.   But my rent&#039;s going up, my salary isn&#039;t, and Japanese media isn&#039;t getting any cheaper.  So, I&#039;m cancelling my subscription, at least for the time being.  If possible I&#039;ll come back someday, in the meantime see you on PORAB.  Thanks for everything!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The form kept errorring for me as well. Here goes!

What did you love about it?
- There wasn&#039;t anything in AJATT+ that I loved... sorry. Well, I got subscription to AJATT+ by buying the MCD pack, and I found the pack quite useful for starting MCDs. 

What did you hate about it?
- Urr... not something I hate, but I noticed that the articles in the MCD pack in the AJATT library is an abridged form of the original articles. I wish the library had full articles... Some details can be quite important, like how pronunciation is taken care of when using MCDs! :D
- Oh and another thing... the forums are overwhelmingly concerned with Japanese. When I read that there was a section for other languages, I had expected it to be bigger. I&#039;m learning French, by the way.

What do you wish it had that it doesn’t yet?
- OH! A SEARCH bar to search within the forums! Would make forums much more useful! Or maybe there is a search bar, but I didn&#039;t find it... :(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is for my first story book, i kept getting an error when i ticked that box and tried to submit the message.

I really liked how simple the story was but how many useful expressions you managed to pack in it. The drawings also were great- props there!

If I could change one thing it would be to make the story a little more varied, the girl didn&#039;t seem to say much and her responses kind of dwelled around &#039;mhmmm&#039; and &#039;nnnn&#039; (which i realize pretty much sums up Japanese girls, that and &#039;kawaii&#039;).]]></description>
