To do things that are very difficult or &quot;impossible&quot;,

First you have to not run away.  That takes seconds.

Then you have to work.  That takes hours.

Then you have to stick at it.  That takes years.

Like I want to go to grad school so I got off my butt and wrote those essays. On the other hand I DON&#039;T want to work and I don&#039;t care how my job goes, so it took forever to get round to drafting a few things for my boss. 

Luckily Japanese falls under the &quot;what I want&quot; group so we&#039;re cool. :-p]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a little something which might prove useful in combo with the programs Katz mentioned. 

http://www.memiary.com/

I&#039;m quoting the guy who sent it to me:

&quot;If you want to take more frequent snapshots of your life, there’s an excellent little online app at memiary.com. It puts emphasis on the stuff you’ve already done (the question What did you do today? greets you every time you log on) but you can type in anything you like, as long as it’s 160 characters or less.

[...]

I’ve been using it for a little more than a month now, so I can’t really comment on the long term looking-back aspect. What I’ve noticed, though, is that it’s quite good at making you (re)evaluate your immediate priorities. Keying in “six hours of useless postgrad lectures” for five days in a row, with a couple fields left blank ’cause I didn’t have time to do much else, was an eye-opening experience of sorts.&quot;

It seems it might be really useful to finding out where you&#039;re loosing your time so you can fill that with even more language immersion goodness (e.g. you can write &quot;went shopping, but didn&#039;t bring the mp3 player. Again&quot;. or &quot;spent 2 hours in front of a TV watching stuff in English instead of Japanese. Again&quot; :) )]]></description>
