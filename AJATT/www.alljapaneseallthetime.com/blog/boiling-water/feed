		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m reading this article again for the first time in a few years.

It&#039;s interesting how the ideology of AJATT has morphed over the years. The mantra now seems like, &quot;Some Japanese, Most of the Time&quot;.

I find that interesting because the method that includes short breaks is probably perceived as an easier route to fluency. But I think the keep-the-heat-on way is actually the easier way to go.

The goal seems more clear cut, when every decision you make is one to deepen your immersion.

I don&#039;t know, that&#039;s just my two yen. It&#039;s been a while since I visited AJATT so I guess I&#039;ve got some catching up to do :)]]></description>

I had Japanese private teacher for over 2 years, did selfstudy in Japanese for 1.5 years and then had to stop taking lessons when I moved abroad. (could not afford it) Now I want to continue my studies, and really I forgot a lot since the 1 year break, even tho I watch Japanese TV shows or anime daily, or listen to J-pop I try to stop taking beraks, and finding excuses. Everyone has at least 10-20 minutes a day before you go to sleep the read thrugh your kanji&#039;s or to learn a few new ones. I have a fulltime job and a part time job (7 days a week) so I can not study 18-24 hours a day like you do. :( I will still try, I started labeling all items in my room with their Japanese names, and I bought myself the laminated Kanjiposter advertised on your site, I will read your site daily yo get fresh motivation, and to feed the fire I need for boiling my water.]]></description>

A beter analogy ( sorry Lane, you went a little too far ) is pushing a car.  Hard at first, but once it&#039;s moving you don&#039;t have to push very hard at all (ignore the having to run along side it).  Stop long enough and friction drives it to a halt and you start all over again.

		<description><![CDATA[I think stellar bodies would be a better comparison.  Or think Katamary Damacy if you like.  Add mass.  You eventually create a star and fusion begins (understanding?).  But it becomes a self-sustaining process...  uh... I didn&#039;t really think this through so bear with me.  If your star is massive enough... then you&#039;ll fuse to iron or lead or something, blow off your lighter elements and implode into a black hole.  This is where I was trying to start my analogy because as you add matter, your Schwarzschild Radius (domain of your knowledge?) grows.  But, as information leaks out in the form of Hawking Radiation, your black hole is literally evaporating.  The SRS will help you sort of &#039;recapture&#039; that Hawking Radiation as it were... To the extent that letting your language black hole atrophy for too long will cause it to literally evaporate and disappear.  On the other hand, continuously adding mass will expand your domain indefinitely.

Hmm... How about it?]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think stellar bodies would be a better comparison.  Or think Katamary Damacy if you like.  Add mass.  You eventually create a star and fusion begins (understanding?).  But it becomes a self-sustaining process&#8230;  uh&#8230; I didn&#8217;t really think this through so bear with me.  If your star is massive enough&#8230; then you&#8217;ll fuse to iron or lead or something, blow off your lighter elements and implode into a black hole.
