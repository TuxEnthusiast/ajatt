		<description><![CDATA[Hi, 
it&#039;s not going to be a comment regarding your last entry (although as always, I enjoyed what you wrote). But I want to live a link to a TED speech, which I think is in sync with this site. One of the phrases from the speech &quot;When there is curiosity, education happens&quot; :D Brilliant!
