				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The day you stop sucking at the language isn&#8217;t the end of the journey, it&#8217;s the beginning.</p>
<p>Universities pay full, luscious lip service to this. Graduation is called &#8220;commencement&#8221;, at least in North America.</p>
<p>But lip service it is. Full lusciousness notwithstanding. It&#8217;s said that most peoples learning &#8212; in fact, all nonfunctional reading &#8212; stops the day they leave school.</p>
<p>But you and I are not most people. And I didn&#8217;t come to give you lip service today. My lips are chapped; it wouldn&#8217;t feel good.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-have-you-been-killing-babies"><strong>Baby care doesn&#8217;t end at birth.</strong></a><br />
<strong>Parenting doesn&#8217;t end when the baby can walk.</strong><br />
<strong>So why, as soon as your linguistic baby can walk, are you thinking of abandoning her?</strong> I can hear an objection: &#8220;Khatz! Calm down, son! I need new challenges! New vistas! I can&#8217;t stagnate! I gotta grow! I&#8217;m not abandoning the baby! I&#8217;m just making another one!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tell that to the baby; she feels as abandoned as fork. You forgot she existed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/language-is-friendship-and-familiarity">Don&#8217;t be a deadbeat dad. Don&#8217;t be a neglectful mother.</a> Stay. Stay in your language child&#8217;s life. Milk it. You came all this way just to leave? OK, OK, I know the parental metaphors are a bit strong. But even in purely utilitarian terms, you&#8217;ll gain more from staying and milking than leaving.</p>
<p>Assuming you&#8217;re enjoying yourself, that is. If you&#8217;re really hating life with the language, then leaving might be the best thing. But I find the reasons most people hate a languages they&#8217;re leaving have to do with trying to extract too much extrinsic value from it too fast. Because <strong>fun is more about how than what.</strong></p>
<p>When a language is part of your identity, a lifestyle and not an object, not a trophy, then, ironically, you relax and and have more fun and de-suck (real word) faster. In other words, you get everything you could ever ask for and more, if you just stop acting and feeling so desperate. And that can be very hard to believe. <strong>Surely the best way to hold onto something is to grip harder, right?</strong> How will this kitty know I love her if I don&#8217;t squeeze her until her spine breaks? That&#8217;s the kind of broken &#8212; but apparently reasonable &#8212; linear logic that overwhelms you when you&#8217;re in that desperate state.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some good old personal anecdote for ya: <strong>In 2004, I decided I was willing to spend my whole life and forget English if I had to in order to get good at Japanese&#8230;</strong>it turns out neither was necessary, but the relaxed state of mind that came from my resignation surely had some power to it. And, yeah, there was a short term goal or two in there; there was the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-bilingual-career-forum-story">career fair</a>, but I never saw the fair as end in itself &#8211; in fact, by the time I physically got there, I was already looking beyond it, learning more, doing more reps; <strong>it was never an endpoint, only a waypoint.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why does this type of resignation work? Why does resigning yourself to a lifetime of Japanese work?</strong> Because what you&#8217;ve really done is <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/boiling-water"><strong>give up&#8230;on giving up</strong></a>. And<span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong> if you&#8217;re never gonna give up, then it doesn&#8217;t matter what method you use or how long it takes, and it definitely doesn&#8217;t matter how you look to other people. </strong></span></p>
<p>On the surface, this &#8220;Playa4Life&#8221; mindset goes against everything we know in terms of, say <a href="http://is.gd/ESB3Jj">temporal motivation theory (TMT)</a>. But there are at least three ways to reconcile that apparent paradox. One is to say that<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/timeboxing-trilogy-part-1-what-and-why"> the other equation components get driven up so high as to drown out the gamma</a>. Another is to play fast and loose with both mathematics and common sense, and argue that infinite gamma and small (near-zero) gamma behave the same. And the third (and incidentally, least elegant) way is to just go &#8212; screw it, TMT isn&#8217;t a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory">GUT</a> or <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%87%E7%89%A9%E3%81%AE%E7%90%86%E8%AB%96">TOE</a>, so it must just not apply here.</p>
<p>So, resignation. <strong>Think of it like holding an egg: in order to successfully hold an egg, you need a combination of firmness and softness</strong>&#8230;In order to successfully hold a language,<strong> you need the firmness of frequent contact (immersion and SRS), but the light softness of just having fun</strong> and not freaking the fork out over your situation, your progress, your vocabulary and stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe one day I&#8217;ll start swearing in writing like a real man. Anyway!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You are not a screw-up. You are not lazy. You work hard. Too hard. At things that don&#8217;t matter. You work hard at struggling and self-blame and self-hate. You work hard at worrying. You work hard at pacing the floor. You work hard at imagining terrifying, low-probability contingencies. You work hard on trying to force yourself, like a stubborn camel, to do things you don&#8217;t want to do in a way you don&#8217;t want to do them.</p>
<p>And it doesn&#8217;t work. It almost never works.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>USE EVEN MORE FORCE! You tell the whole world your goals, in order to force social pressure onto you. You write yourself expletive-laden notes, memos and messages. You use all-caps so that you DON&#8217;T FORGET. You try to get yourself to be a gentleman, to be a lady, to be more cultured, more civilized, by being increasingly cruel and uncivil and ungentle to yourself.</p>
<p>And therein lies the problem. You&#8217;re violating the very principles you claim to value in order to instill those same principles. Sort of like a parent screaming: &#8220;STOP F###ING SWEARING!!!!&#8221;. Sort of like violently invading a country and then imposing military rule on it, in order to turn into a peaceful, pluralistic, self-sustaining democracy. It would be comical if you weren&#8217;t so serious about it.</p>
<p><a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%99%E3%83%AB%E3%83%88%E3%83%BB%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3">Did not the man of one stone </a>tell us that you can&#8217;t solve a problem at using the same level of thinking that created it? <strong>You can&#8217;t beat and berate yourself into finesse. You can&#8217;t scare yourself into calming down.</strong> <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/beyond-binging-and-purging-why-you-maybe-shouldnt-try-overcorrecting-for-when-you-screw-up">You can&#8217;t binge yourself into balanced behavior</a> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Which is probably why crash diets don&#8217;t work, at least behaviorally. Apparently there are some metabolic issues with them as well." id="return-note-29804-1" href="#note-29804-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Try this on for size: everything you do is right. Even when it&#8217;s wrong. Everything you do is right. <strong>Everything you do is <em>structurally</em> right. </strong>How do I know? Because you&#8217;re doing it.<strong> If it weren&#8217;t structured right, you couldn&#8217;t do it, you wouldn&#8217;t do it, and you wouldn&#8217;t keep doing it.</strong></p>
<p>Everything you do is a solution to a problem. The solution you&#8217;re choosing may be misguided, laborious and/or counterproductive, but it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that you were sincerely trying to solve a problem. You are a good person who sometimes picks (very) bad solutions.</p>
<p>Everything you do is right. It may or may not be misguided, but it&#8217;s right. So when you watch TV instead of touching that important project? You did a (not the, but a) right thing. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-accomplish-great-things-small-victories-winnable-games">The solution is simple: <strong>make the thing you&#8217;re &#8220;supposed&#8221; to be doing more like watching TV. (Re-) model your desired behavior on your avoidance behavior</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Your avoidance behavior is pointing you to something; your avoidance behavior is structured in such a way that makes it fun, and what&#8217;s more, this structure is independent of the actual content of the behavior. Make your &#8220;work&#8221; function and proceed like &#8220;play&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s something of an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: You keep looking up <a href="http://Cracked.com" class="autohyperlink" title="http://Cracked.com" target="_blank">Cracked.com</a> or <a href="http://TVTropes.org" class="autohyperlink" title="http://TVTropes.org" target="_blank">TVTropes.org</a> instead of doing Japanese.
<ul>
<li>Solution 0: Feel guilty and berate yourself. Do it hard, so you feel like a total schmuck and don&#8217;t want to do anything (let alone keep living) any more. This is what you and most other people typically do. Hint: stop choosing this one.</li>
<li>Solution 1: Find a Japanese equivalent to <a href="http://Cracked.com" class="autohyperlink" title="http://Cracked.com" target="_blank">Cracked.com</a> (or <a href="http://TVTropes.org" class="autohyperlink" title="http://TVTropes.org" target="_blank">TVTropes.org</a>)</li>
<li>Solution 2: Google Japanese websites that talk <em>about</em> <a href="http://Cracked.com" class="autohyperlink" title="http://Cracked.com" target="_blank">Cracked.com</a> (or <a href="http://TVTropes.org" class="autohyperlink" title="http://TVTropes.org" target="_blank">TVTropes.org</a> or whatever) and how funny it is</li>
<li>Solution 3: Google Japanese discussions (blogs, vlogs, fora, books, etc.) about one or more of the weird topics you find yourself reading and laughing about on <a href="http://Cracked.com" class="autohyperlink" title="http://Cracked.com" target="_blank">Cracked.com</a> (or <a href="http://TVTropes.org" class="autohyperlink" title="http://TVTropes.org" target="_blank">TVTropes.org</a>). There are plenty of Japanese websites about weirdness in movies and surprising scientific phenomena and whatnot. In fact, because Hollywood movies are a foreign (if common) phenomenon in Japan, Japanese viewers are even more naturally able to &#8220;step outside&#8221; them and point out the unconscious clichés, genreisms and strangely recurring lines of dialog.</li>
<li>Solution 4: Roll your own. Make up something weird but easy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The point is, <strong>don&#8217;t look away from what you&#8217;re doing &#8220;wrong&#8221;</strong> as if it were some dirty, shameful thing, like a regretfully randy hook-up that you&#8217;re now embarrassed about. <strong>Look at it</strong> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Kind of like how you look at the solids and liquids that come out of your body (don&#8217;t make me get specific) with child-like curiosity." id="return-note-29804-2" href="#note-29804-2"><sup>2</sup></a><strong> deeply and <em>directly</em> and from many angles and see how you can use (part of) it for good</strong> &#8212; like using nuclear power for electricity instead of burning children and teddy bears.</p>
<p>We tend to talk and get upset about what we&#8217;re <em>not</em> doing, as if our &#8220;non-productive&#8221; times were spent in a state of catatonia, holding rigid for hours, staring at a wall, literally doing nothing. But we&#8217;re actually always doing something. We talk about how we&#8217;re &#8220;not practicing Japanese&#8221;, when in fact we are simply practicing English. <strong>We are always doing <em>something</em></strong>, and if we&#8217;re not doing something else, it&#8217;s because that something else is very poorly structured, because if it were correctly structured&#8230;we&#8217;d be doing it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/japanese-is-useless-and-a-waste-of-time-stop-learning-it">&#8220;But I <em>have to</em> do the work, Khatz!&#8221;, you protest. Do you? You <em>have to</em> learn Japanese? No, you don&#8217;t. You could <em>not</em> do it.</a> In fact, you&#8217;re already not doing it right now. And you&#8217;re still alive. You don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to do anything. Other people tell you that just to get you to STFU and follow their orders. <strong>Pretty much the only thing you <em>have</em> to do is breathe, and yet that&#8217;s one of the first things you stop doing</strong> &#8212; worried people tend to take very shallow breaths, as well as subconsciously hold their breath &#8212; as soon as you&#8217;re a bit scared. I&#8217;m not saying they won&#8217;t try to do mean things to you in order to get you to do the thing you didn&#8217;t do, but that just means new situations and new choices.</p>
<p>So how do you turn &#8220;work&#8221; into &#8220;play&#8221;? I do not know exactly; each situation varies. But here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out a way to avoid doing it altogether. Like, totally not do it at all, not simply delay it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Failing that&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Small time increments (pico-tasking, microtasking instead of multitasking &#8212; in other words, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/timeboxing-trilogy-part-1-what-and-why">timeboxing</a>)</li>
<li>Focus on the now, not on the big picture.
<ul>
<li>What? Yes. Focus on the now, not on the big picture? Isn&#8217;t that dangerous, though? No, not if the small picture is a part of the actual big picture you want.</li>
<li>The problem we have right now is that <strong>everyone at least vaguely knows what big picture they want, but almost everyone SUCKS with a capital &#8220;S&#8221; at picking small pictures that produce that big picture</strong>. So they instead pick completely irrelevant small pictures or (worse) small pictures that look like the big picture.</li>
<li>Think about it, though &#8212; <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/quantity-time-is-quality-time">a picture of Reese Witherspoon isn&#8217;t made up of other pictures of Reese Witherspoon; it&#8217;s made up of pixels that look nothing like Reese Witherspoon. </a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/quantity-time-is-quality-time">Your cells aren&#8217;t little people; they look and act and live and die nothing like you. Similarly, <strong>your small picture actions will look or feel almost useless</strong> <a class="simple-footnote" title="like Wayne Gretzky (apparently) inexplicably skating into open, puckless space." id="return-note-29804-3" href="#note-29804-3"><sup>3</sup></a></a> <strong> &#8212; </strong>not counterproductive, just comically piecemeal; this happens to be precisley how learning kanji shape and meaning without learning readings, Heisig style, feels to most people. &#8220;This is too small! This is too easy! This is too little and too late! There&#8217;s no <em>way</em> this could help! So I&#8217;m gonna go back to watching English language TV&#8221; (which, ironically, is less than 0% effective at improving your Japanese&#8230;it&#8217;s weird&#8230;<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/failing-gracefully">choosing 0% [or less] instead of 0.1%</a>). <a class="simple-footnote" title="We constantly abandon the now and the good enough in pursuit of the perfect, but, if you play the etymology game, to be perfect (think: perfect tense) means to be complete, finished, done with &#8212; dead. Nothing that lives, that is alive and growing and changing can be perfect. Perfection is death. Maybe that&#8217;s why we love people so much when they&#8217;re dead   ." id="return-note-29804-4" href="#note-29804-4"><sup>4</sup></a>
<ul>
<li>This useless feeling is a false intuition. Kind of like how the Earth doesn&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s moving or spinning even though it&#8217;s doing both. Small picture actions, if well-directed, will be anything but useless.
<ul>
<li>How do you know how to correctly direct your small picture actions? Easy. Let&#8217;s say your getting used to Japanese. Your question is: &#8220;can I hear and/or see Japanese right now?&#8221;. If you can answer in the affirmative, then you&#8217;re direction is perfect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Furthermore, small picture actions will, if well-structured, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-accomplish-great-things-small-victories-winnable-games">be a lot of fun</a> &#8212; more fun, even, than our typically-considered-as-fun entertainments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I know this small picture/big picture thing kinda contradicts the<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/before-fluency-after-fluency"> Before Fluency/After Fluency quasi-enlightenment thing</a>&#8230;deal with it <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://is.gd/tmHpu4">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi of Flow</a> fame offers: &#8220;<a href="http://is.gd/IVYs4i">the more a job inherently resembles a game &#8212; with variety, appropriate and flexible challenges, clear goals and immediate feedback &#8212; the more enjoyable it will be regardless of the worker&#8217;s level of development</a>&#8220;.
<ul>
<li>Which, if you think about it, is the same as the idea of <a href="http://goo.gl/hPRhy">&#8220;SMART&#8221; goals, minus the boorish preachiness.</a></li>
<li>&#8230;And is also the same as the idea of <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-accomplish-great-things-small-victories-winnable-games">&#8220;winnable games&#8221;.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t ever try to get the whole thing done. That&#8217;s like trying to clear every screen, every boss and every level of a video game all at once by pushing one button</strong> (and, oh, <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%94%BB%E7%95%A5%E6%9C%AC">never doing any research, because we all know that&#8217;s a waste of time(!)</a>). Just move forward.</li>
<li>Ask better questions: Not &#8220;why can&#8217;t you just get this done?!&#8221;.
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re not sure how dumb your questions are, try strategically replacing their key nouns with nouns like &#8220;FIFA&#8221; and &#8220;World of Warcraft&#8221;. So, like:
<ul>
<li>&#8220;why can&#8217;t you just stop dallying and get your <em>FIFA</em> playing done?!!&#8221;;</li>
<li>&#8220;why don&#8217;t you ever play <em>WoW</em> like you&#8217;re supposed to?!&#8221;;</li>
<li>&#8220;would it kill you to just finish a game you started once in a while?!&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&#8230;and you&#8217;ll see how saying things to yourself like: &#8220;I gotta get this all done NOW!&#8221; or &#8220;I shoulda had this done by now!&#8221; or &#8220;I shoulda got this done yesterday&#8221; is so transcendantally stupid, dangerous and useless.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Games are not inherently interesting, only structurally interesting. Copy the structure &#8212; variety, flexible challenges, clear goals, immediate feedback &#8212; reverse-engineer the Steele equation, and you win.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8220;Mallory is famously quoted as having replied to the question &#8220;Why do you want to climb Mount Everest?&#8221; with the retort &#8220;Because it&#8217;s there&#8221;&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://goo.gl/57xw">[George Mallory - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Growing up, I had the privilege of interacting with people from a wide range of social classes on a daily basis. I didn&#8217;t think too much of it at the time; I thought that&#8217;s just how the world worked. It was&#8230;well, it just seemed like it was what it was.</p>
<p>But now I realize that what it was&#8230;was edifying.</p>
<p>While I actually had the benefit of observing this kind of thing first-hand, first-hand observation really isn&#8217;t necessary; you could just imagine it. In any case, I noticed a lot of big talk and overbite among aristocrats, and I noticed a lot of plodding, action and drinking among builders.</p>
<p>Aristocrats &#8212; and people who think like them &#8212; have courage and vision but lack even basic knowledge and all sense of practicality; they are deeply disconnected from reality.</p>
<p>Builders lack all sense of vision. They&#8217;re too busy laying bricks, too busy going to through the motions to really step back and wonder why and wherefore. They&#8217;re too busy moving to think where they&#8217;re going. &#8220;Too busy making a living to get rich&#8221;, as Dan Kennedy once quipped, paraphrasing someone else. But they are willing and able to work, and if simply given a direction, they will move in it.</p>
<p>Case in point: everybody, everywhere is learning a language. You are &#8220;learning&#8221; English right now, reading this. Right now, every single human being, everywhere in the world, is learning a language. He&#8217;s practicing it; he&#8217;s building new vocab, making new connections; he&#8217;s reinforcing it; he&#8217;s dreaming in it. So<strong> everybody is a language laborer. The only question is, what is the <em>direction</em> of your labor?</strong> It&#8217;s not whether or not you&#8217;re laboring at a language, because you are, the only question is <em>which</em> language.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fashionable to put down aristocrats and pedestalize working class values. The opposite used to be the case. But <strong>both approaches are going to get you nowhere.</strong> Acting too aristocratic will kill you quickly in a blaze of glory; acting too working-class will kill you slowly from the inside and out, wearing you down with purposeless drudgery and struggle-for-the-sake-of-struggle. Aristocratic thought will give you direction but get you nowhere; working class action will lack bold and overarching direction, and thus also get you nowhere.</p>
<p>Mountaineer George Mallory wasn&#8217;t titled or anything, to my knowledge, but he did go to Winchester and Cambridge, so he&#8217;s pretty durn aristocratic. And that&#8217;s why he could do such Churchillian one-liners in praise of uselessnes. Even though (or perhaps because) I&#8217;m afraid of everything, and don&#8217;t myself climb or do anything remotely brave or dangerous, I&#8217;ve been reading quite a bit about moutaineering lately. And something hit me in my reading of books like the controversial <a href="http://is.gd/HX3V9X"><em>Into Thin Air </em>(空へ)</a> and <a href="http://is.gd/cwaC7A">that other Russian guy&#8217;s book</a>.</p>
<p>What follows is all second- and third-hand information filtered through my Khatzumoto fact distortion field, so feel free to correct me if you know better. Here it is.</p>
<p>One doesn&#8217;t &#8220;climb&#8221; Everest. That is, the people who &#8220;climbed&#8221; Everest didn&#8217;t really climb it. Not in the heroic, one-man one-mountain, ice-pick and crampon way that we tend to think.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>Sherpas climb Everest. They take virtually all the real risks; theirs is the highest death rate; they lay the rope; they set up the ladders; they carry the food and oxygen and all the other luggage; they set up the tents at each of the camps along the way. Sherpas set up everything; the whole infrastructure. And then everybody else kinda sorta <em>hikes</em> Everest.</p>
<p>But someone needed to give the Sherpas direction, to make it worth their while, to encourage them to dare to be stupid, to get them excited and fired up &#8212; because they&#8217;re just as up for adventure and derring-do as anyone else &#8211; and those someones are, literally and figuratively, <strong>aristocrats, which is to say, people who want to spend real time, real money and real effort doing really dumb and unnecessary things &#8212; like learning Japanese &#8212; for the heck of it</strong>. Because make no mistake, there is no socially redeeming value in mountaineering; no one&#8217;s finding a cure for a cancer up there; it&#8217;s cold and squalid and painful and hard to breathe and you might even die.</p>
<p>So, should people stop climbing mountains? Absolutely not. Mountaineering is play for grown-ups, and play doesn&#8217;t need to justify itself. Preventing stupidity (that doesn&#8217;t harm others) is stupid; every society that has done it has stagnated. <a href="http://is.gd/mrJOid">That&#8217;s why this sensible book is one of the dumbest and most dangerous ever written.</a> Hubris drives progress. Chutzpah drives progress. Arrogance and stupidity, real and apparent, drive progress &#8212; and the best part is, if you want, you can sit back and reaps all the benefits without taking any of the risks: it&#8217;s an investor&#8217;s wet dream. No frostbite or edema for you.</p>
<p>As Abraham Flexner pointed out in his essay (monograph?), <em>The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge,</em> useless now becomes useful later, in totally unforeseen ways. Call it serendipity, call it <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb">epistemic blindness</a>, call it what you like, but almost none of the tools and knowledge we now collectively have, use and/or value today would be here if they&#8217;d have had to prove themselves &#8220;useful&#8221; from the get-go.</p>
<p>They just wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Invisible waves, concentric patterns made by iron filings, and kites in rainstorms were not useful. Instead of figuring out how to suck dirt, that Hoover guy or gal should have rolled up his sleeves and used a broom like a <em>normal</em> person. I remember when cellphones started to appear on TV more and more; the non-geeks in my life couldn&#8217;t see the &#8220;use&#8221;; I couldn&#8217;t see the &#8220;use&#8221; either, I just thought they were cool. But who&#8217;s addicted to their cellphones now? Much more non-geeks than geeks. Geeks make the Face Book and the Twitters, non-geeks get hooked on them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The philosophies of one age have become the absurdities of the next, and the foolishness of yesterday has become the wisdom of tomorrow.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/w/williamosl393275.html">William Osler</a></p></blockquote>
<p>What use is sending electronic messages through computer networks? That&#8217;s gay and geeky! Letters work just fine! What use is inventing a writing system and writing s##t down? Just memorize it &#8212; like a <em>real</em> man! What use is a horseless carriage?! They all just break down anyhow! Why do you need a compass?! You should have a sense of direction already!</p>
<p>The aristocratic mindset focuses too much on eternity. The working class mindset focuses too much on immediate utility. Alone, both are useless. Together they are powerful. And you can have them together in your own mind. You kinda need to, because other people can&#8217;t think, pee or learn languages for you.</p>
<p>In history, we talk way too much about wars; I think wars are a stupid and overly bellicose way to analyze history, let alone live life. Perhaps I&#8217;m bellicose about bellicosity. Whatever, anyway. We talk about Caesar as if he personally conquered Gaul. He did nothing of the such. He was <em>never</em> out there sweating and raping and murdering and enslaving Celtic villagers: he had people &#8212; builders, destroyers &#8212; doing that for him; he was sitting in a command tent getting massages from a rentboy and sipping Mimosas while moving Lego pieces around on a parchment map; he gave the vision, they gave the muscle, the legwork. He gave dogma (?), they gave pragma.</p>
<p>So where am I going with this? As usual, I&#8217;ve spread myself too thin, tried to sound too clever, made too many socially disturbing assertions and backed them up too little. Yet the show must go on. So here goes. The only difference between war and murder is direction &#8212; spin. <strong>The only difference between living your life and learning Japanese is direction &#8212; spin.</strong> In war, you basically murder people. In learning Japanese, you basically live your life; you really do. Just with Japanese artifacts and objects instead of English-language ones.</p>
<p>But <strong>if you don&#8217;t fire up that inner aristocrat, you&#8217;re gonna be just a builder, living the default life you were given, in the default language and country you were given, and all within a twenty-five-mile radius of where you were born.</strong> Quaint? Yes. Romantic? Maybe. Interesting? Meh.</p>
<p>Let your inner aristocrat pronounce a bold, mad, stupid vision: &#8220;I am Japanese&#8221;, and then let your inner Sherpas set up immersion camps all the way up to the top &#8212; Japanese speakers in this room, iPod loaded in that room, subscriptions to Japanese premium cable, IMX in your email, whatever it takes.</p>
<p>And then walk on up and be a hero. Just remember to thank your Sherpas, and know that it&#8217;s them that did the work; you weren&#8217;t talented; you weren&#8217;t brave; you weren&#8217;t even competent; you certainly weren&#8217;t hard-working; you were just crazy and fun to be with. And together &#8212; not alone, but together &#8212; you and Tenzing climbed Everest.</p>
<p>Alexander the Great? Wouldn&#8217;ta been so great on his own. He and his people were <em>both</em> essential to the project of&#8230;random and unprecedented Hellenic imperium. Jordan and Pippen both needed each other &#8211; together, they ruled basketball; alone, they were two guys who used to rule basketball. <strong>You need both sides of yourself, the mad side to dream of towers and mansions, and the practical side to lay Lego bricks of fluency one at a time until they stack up high enough.</strong></p>
<p>Now, this kind of thing should go without saying. But it doesn&#8217;t, so I will. Say it, that is. I am not a fan of hereditary ruling elites&#8230;or of ruling elites, period. In no small part because what you get with hereditary ruling elites is stagnant societies ruled by ugly, in-bred people who had one or two Good Guy Greg ancestors (case in point: the Medici ruling family of Florence&#8230;look at the first ones and then look at what they turned into <a class="simple-footnote" title="And let&#8217;s not even go into how Florence&#8217;s rejection of its once-flourishing meritocracy killed innovation and vitality along with social mobility. For a time, Florence was easily the greatest city in Europe. Now, it&#8217;s a tourist attraction at most. Literally, a shell of its former self. Then again, I&#8217;m totally biased. If you or I had reached the absolute top of the heap, the temptation to kick away the ladder would be fierce. I am under no illusions as to what I would do: I would prevent social mobility in order to &#8220;protect&#8221; myself, and I would tell myself that my progeny would rule just fine because I would raise them to rule &#8212; it&#8217;s a lie, but I&#8217;d believe it because believing it would be far too convenient to pass up. On the bright side, maybe Florence is a good enough reverse object lesson; maybe humanity learns from its collective mistakes, despite the many slip-ups along the way.

Ultimately, all you get is decay and decadence because the entire society runs on pure, unadulterated nepotism. The rulers are out of touch with reality and the ruled stopped having abstract thoughts around puberty. You don&#8217;t want that. Nobody but the delusionally nostalgic (<em>ahem</em> <em>cough</em> Alain de Botton <em>cough clearthroat</em>) want to live in that world. But you can take the good from both sides and make something that doesn&#8217;t suck. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m saying.</p>
<p>Disclaimers aside, back to our regular programming.</p>
<p>Aristocratic questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What&#8217;s fun?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s elegant?</li>
<li>What can I do forever?</li>
</ul>
<p>Bob the Builder questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What can I do right now?</li>
<li>What can I do for the next month?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s useful right here and now?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask both types.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no doubt about it. Living to amuse yourself is lonely and pathetic.</p>
<p>But so is living to impress the Joneses. That lifestyle leaves you feeling plenty empty inside; it&#8217;s always psychologically impoverishing and often monetarily so as well. One either dies trying to fill one&#8217;s life with the accoutrements of Jonesiness (BTW, I have IRL friends who are Joneses and they&#8217;re the nicest people in the world), or &#8220;succeeds&#8221; in doing so only to realize that, well, one has won gold at the Idiot Olympics.</p>
<p>It can be sobering to realize that everything you own will eventually end up as trash, burned or buried &#8212; even your own body. Are not cemeteries merely human landfills? Not to mention the whole &#8220;the Sun will turn red giant and burn the Earth to a crisp&#8221; story. And so you are literally buying trash and competing over trash. Living in urban Japan forces these kinds of realizations to hit you early and continually &#8211; since living spaces are so small, you&#8217;re either an episode of <em>Hoarders</em> or you&#8217;re constantly throwing &#8220;perfectly good&#8221; things away; at first it feels bad, but then it feels good.</p>
<p>If hypocrisy were blood sugar, I would be dead and my body would taste sweet. Whether by constitution or conditioning, I&#8217;ve been competitive &#8212; stupidly, pettily so &#8212; from an early age. I&#8217;m afraid of literally everything except cats and leashed dogs, so I like to live in low places &#8212; low floors in hotels and apartment buildings; I like being able to just up and leave the building without recourse to an elevator; I like it where my cats can safely jump out a window. Yet, whenever I board an elevator, and someone else pushes a higher-floor button than me, I feel like <em>less</em> of a person.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty effing petty. And it doesn&#8217;t take a Zen monk with forty years of experience in the meditation industry to realize how dumb this all is. Anyone living in an apartment building or a hotel is a pawn; the real baller is the owner of a building. So comparing penis size or (as the case may be) floor height is like being two medieval soldiers having an arm wrestling competition: you&#8217;re still a pawn in a chess game being played by the king; he&#8217;s gonna wind you up with some BS speech about the feast of Saint Crispin; you&#8217;re gonna fight for him and lose your life or a limb and/or get multiple infections, oh, and, after this is all over, the king will be boinking some erstwhile enemy French princess who smells of peaches and Camembert cheese. But, yeah, nice job with the arm wrestling, maybe some toothless bar wench with armpit lice will smile at you.</p>
<blockquote><p>「I like living. I have sometimes been wildly, despairingly, acutely miserable, racked with sorrow; but through it all I still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing.」<br />
─ Agatha Christie</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of the deeper-thinking personal development people will tell you that the only reason we do anything is because we think it&#8217;ll make us feel good. So, ultimately, it&#8217;s all about experiencing a certain set of pleasant emotional states, particularly that of you liking yourself. It&#8217;s a compelling idea.</p>
<p>And if it is indeed correct, then you&#8217;re likely to find that living to amuse yourself is not only easier (and thus smarter) but also funner. The only reason we even do &#8220;hard&#8221; things is if and because they (are said to) make life easier overall. Human beings always choose (what they perceive to be) the easy route. Even people who join cults that make them suffer physically, do so to be relieved of the intellectual burden of <del>realizing that the AJATT cult is the only true cult I mean</del> thinking for themselves.</p>
<p>What does any of this pseudo-profound<em> ersatz</em> philosophy have to do with getting used to languages?</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s plenty of intellectual jockery associated with language learning, and it&#8217;s just as dumb as regular, physical jockery. It&#8217;s just as meaningless. Language learning is perhaps the only field in my life where I&#8217;ve largely set myself free from competition, and that allows me to take risks and run experiments, which leads to even more progress and, dare I say it, success.</p>
<p>Stephen Covey famously wrote and spoke about the private victory that precedes the public victory. I have found that, in modern life, where we live (for better or worse, often for better) quite separated from other people, for language skill to be created and maintained, the bedroom matters more than the classroom: the things you do in your bedroom, the books you read there, the TV you watch there, the languages you use there, that&#8217;s your real life, that&#8217;s your own private world. It&#8217;s when this world becomes filled with, say, Japanese, that you&#8217;ll see outer manifestations of fluency.</p>
<p>But that almost won&#8217;t matter, because it&#8217;s all for and about you anyway. You don&#8217;t even care that you won the marathon, you were just having a fun jaunt &#8212; very Forrest Gumpy. I kid you not, you may literally not notice. Strangers come and go. Even family can become impermanent if you move around a lot. But you&#8217;ll be there. Impress yourself. Amuse yourself. Entertain yourself. Quantify yourself. Record yourself. Compete with yourself.</p>
<p>Or not. I dunno. Maybe I&#8217;m just lame and antisocial  and trying to justify it <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>
<p>PS: I used &#8220;aspy&#8221; as an adjective rather than a noun. Prolly also misspelled it. Oh, the horror <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe this one should be called &#8220;why life is so good to you, but you don&#8217;t realize it&#8221;.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/dont-start-clean-start-dirty-why-a-clean-slate-is-bad-for-you-and-what-to-do-about-it">Starting dirty is amazing.</a></p>
<p>Remember how video games were back in the 1970s, 1980s and even the first part of the 1990s? No? Well, let me jog your memory: you couldn&#8217;t save!</p>
<p>YA COULDN&#8217;T SAVE! You couldn&#8217;t save your place. So if you messed up, you were back at square one, as if nothing had happened. And you had to do it all in one sitting &#8212; you couldn&#8217;t take a rest. Maybe you could leave your console on, but even if your mother was cool with you doing things that were &#8220;bad for the TV&#8221;, she would inevitably come around with the vacuum cleaner and inadvertently yank the power cord out of the outlet.</p>
<p>Have you ever wished you could go back in time and do it all over again, knowing what you know now?</p>
<p>Well, stop doing that.</p>
<p>Because that&#8217;s what it would be like. It would be like first gen Mario. Yeah, you&#8217;d have all your wisdom from your previous tries, but you&#8217;d also be living the plot of <em>Groundhog Day</em>.</p>
<p>Now, as usual, there are <em>massive </em>logical holes in my reasoning here; I&#8217;ve never been accused of constructing airtight arguments. For one thing, what you want is not the ability to go start totally clean, but the ability to go back to a savepoint.</p>
<p>Well, life kind of gives you that already. You can&#8217;t quite restart from a savepoint, but you can start anew today &#8212; every day is New Year&#8217;s. Every second presents you with new choices &#8212; with new opportunity to make new choices. And, you get to keep all the wisdom and XP you&#8217;ve gained so far.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t restart your Japanese learning from scratch. Don&#8217;t decapitate yourself just because you have a zit. Don&#8217;t burn down the library to fix a typo. Start with everything you have now. Start proud and dirty.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&#8217;s the point of even trying? What&#8217;s the point of even showing up? What&#8217;s the point of starting or continuing anything when other people are so much better at it than you? What&#8217;s the point of doing anything you&#8217;re not already and instantly the best in the world at? Why endure the shame, the laughter, the mockery, the derision, the doubts, the loneliness, the slips and falls, the embarrassment, the never-ending loss of dignity?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point of even going to space if you&#8217;re not going to out-Armstrong Neil Armstrong? What&#8217;s the point of having money if other people are just going to have more if it than you? What&#8217;s the point of having a TV if it isn&#8217;t the biggest in the neighborhood &#8212; in the world? What&#8217;s the point of having a house if it isn&#8217;t the swankiest house in the history of houses? What&#8217;s the point of having nice things that no one else can see, let alone realizes are nice?</p>
<p>Are you even worthy? Do you even deserve to learn a language? Aren&#8217;t you just clogging up the pipes of the world with your suckiness? Wouldn&#8217;t it be better if you just grew up, grew a pair and stopped trying and took your dignity home with you?</p>
<p>Like, better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt, right? At least if you never try, you have infinite possibilities, because nobody in the world knows what you could have become if you <em>had</em> tried.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s unpack this.<br />
↑ My new favorite catchphrase.</p>
<p>They own at it. But they don&#8217;t own it. Not exclusively.</p>
<p>You are not better than Usain Bolt.<br />
And he is not better than you.</p>
<p>He is better &#8212; faster &#8212; at training for and thus running one hundred meter races (and not even twice as fast, just a couple seconds faster) than you are. But that doesn&#8217;t matter because:<br />
1) He <em>totally</em> isn&#8217;t competing against you: let me assure you of that. You&#8217;re not even in his league, and<br />
2) He&#8217;s totally not in your league either. He never could and never will make it into your league. Because you and previous versions of you are the only people in your league. You aren&#8217;t competing against him and he&#8217;s not competing against you. He breaks his own personal bests (world records), and so should you. You&#8217;re competing against yourself, against your beginner self, against previous versions of yourself, against future (yes, future) versions of yourself. We all run alone. We&#8217;re all in this alone together.</p>
<p>You and Mr. Bolt both have a right to run.<br />
Leonard Susskind doesn&#8217;t own theoretical physics just because he&#8217;s doing so much more of it (and so much better) than you.<br />
The textbook writers don&#8217;t own the subject.<br />
The top pro leagues don&#8217;t own the sport.<br />
The JLPT people don&#8217;t own Japanese just because they know more of it than you.</p>
<p>And you don&#8217;t own it either. We&#8217;re all tenants, and we all get just about one vote in the association.<br />
The penthouse tenant doesn&#8217;t own the building: he&#8217;s just in its most widely desired unit.<br />
One day, maybe you&#8217;ll be living in it.<br />
Or maybe you&#8217;ll take the easy, cunning choice and make up your own game &#8212; cup-stacking, beersbee and ballroom dancing are all sports &#8212; and you can be its penthouse tenant. Maybe you&#8217;ll invent the ten meter race, just to prove a point <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not worthy&#8221;, they say.</p>
<p>Of course you&#8217;re worthy, you stupid turd. You may suck (for now), you may suck forever, but you&#8217;re always worthy.</p>
<p>The only reason you even care about other people is because you spend far too much time thinking of and about them, and far too little time thinking of and about yourself. You know their names, their big dates, their famous numbers and stats, but you barely know any of your own. You don&#8217;t even bother collecting your own stats properly; you don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re worth collecting &#8212; and that&#8217;s a strange thought coming from a totally unique, irreplaceable, induplicable person.</p>
<p>If you did actually bother to run your own stats, you&#8217;d start to notice that all cumulative stats only ever increase (or flatline). Your total number of goals scored can only ever go up. And that alone is encouraging enough to keep you playing forever.</p>
<p>You know how, like, there can be a chick&#8230;sorry, a sheila &#8212; who&#8217;s been your friend forever and never even registered on your radar, but one day you suddenly start thinking she&#8217;s cute?</p>
<p>You are that chick. And you&#8217;ve never bothered to notice yourself. You&#8217;ve never bothered to take an interest in yourself. You&#8217;re just the chick next door. You&#8217;re just the guy who lives across the hallway, with whom you share an awkward-but-comforting familiarity&#8230;sometimes you say &#8220;hi&#8221; to each other when picking up the mail, but try to avoid eye contact because you can&#8217;t think of what to say for smalltalk this is not autobiographical by the way <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  . You&#8217;re just the inhabitant of your body.</p>
<p>So, back to our original question:<br />
What&#8217;s the point?<br />
What&#8217;s the point of it all? What&#8217;s the point of any of it?</p>
<p>There is no point. But it might be fun&#8230;if you let it be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I get all kinds of emails from breathless kids wanting me to tell them exactly how to do it &#8212; how to get used to a language. And they want it all, they want to know every single detail. They&#8217;ve never made an MCD in their life, but they want to know right now, in advance, exactly whether what they&#8217;re doing is right and whether or not it&#8217;s going to work.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that kind of conscientiousness&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;Except for its timing.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s pretend that you&#8217;re cheap with your money but loose with your time (read: a college student lol) so you&#8217;ve decided to take a road trip from Nueva York to Los Angels. Do you really need to know every twist and turn? Do you really need a list of every single turn and every single road between Russ &amp; Daughters on Houston Street and the BookOff in Torrance?</p>
<p>No. <strong>All you actually need to know is the <em>next</em> step, the <em>next</em> turn.</strong> And when you get there, you can check again to make sure you&#8217;re going in the right direction, ask around (the map is not the territory &#8212; things go out of date quite rapidly; roads are under repair sometimes). If you&#8217;re a beginner (whether a total beginner or a beginner in a new phase), the first step is the next step, so all you need to know is the first step.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t even need to know whether or not what you&#8217;re doing is gonna work. In most cases, your problem is not bad action but total inaction.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to listen to me that hard in the beginning. You just need to get started. When to really listen to me is in the middle, when I tell you you&#8217;re not hearing enough Japanese or you need to start buying Japanese books long before you can even understand them, or&#8230;whatever.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in the MIDDLE that you need my advice. It&#8217;s your mid-game that needs work. It&#8217;s your mid-game that needs my help most, not your opening game. Even the worst methods in the world (read: school) can get people to so-called &#8220;intermediate&#8221; level &#8212; middling proficiency where you know quite a bit but you also start to realize (and let yourself become oppressed by) the magnitude of what you <em>don&#8217;t</em> know.</p>
<p>But it takes an AntiMoon, an AJATT-like method to take you from middling intermediate to advanced and native-like awesomeness.</p>
<p>Now, here is where life starts to imitate Greek tragedy: even though mid-game is where people need my advice most, it is also when they are least likely to take it. Cassandra becomes my middle name. By mid-game, you&#8217;ve got rhythm and habits and prejudices, good and bad. You&#8217;ve got firm beliefs. It really is ironic, because in the beginning, people are so open to instruction, so bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, so virgin snow-like that they even suspend their belief in common sense. Example:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it OK if I watch movies in Japanese, Khatz?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Is rap music OK to listen to, Khatz?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Is it OK if I watch American movies dubbed into Japanese, Khatz? Won&#8217;t I pick up bad dub habits?&#8221;</p>
<p>To me, these questions defy belief. If I sit back calmly, sip some organic milk, and have just had a professional massage, then I&#8217;ve got enough control over my anger reflex to not just lash out with a flippant remark, and I can momentarily see how a person could be asking me questions like those. Incidentally, the answer to all of those questions is simple:</p>
<p>Do Japanese kids do it?<br />
Then 999,999 out of a million times, it&#8217;ll be good for you to do, too.</p>
<p>But, yeah, Cassandra syndrome, because by mid-game, not only do unorthodox methods get rejected, so does common sense. Beginners often refuse to think for themselves while intermediates refuse any ideas that defy those they accepted as beginners.</p>
<p>This Greek tragedy business is both globally and locally true. So you even see it on small scales. Guy who&#8217;s decided to make MCDs has five million questions for me. But once he&#8217;s made some, my small-but-significant corrections and suggestions fall on deaf ears. He goes from&#8230;I dunno&#8230;something to something else. How to not be that guy? Make some MCDs first&#8230;try stuff for a few weeks first, and then show me what you&#8217;ve tried and ask me about it.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Opening game is a quantity problem, not a quality problem. Get Japanese in your ears. Get Japanese in your eyes. Get kanji coming out of your hand. It&#8217;s all about volume. It&#8217;s mid-game where clever tweaks start to carry more weight. It&#8217;s mid-game where I want you to hang on my every word (not literally, but&#8230;yeah).</p>
<p>Mid-game is when I want you to be open to suggestions and corrections, because at mid-game, I&#8217;m making suggestions and corrections based on actual data &#8212; experiential data that you have been so kind as to accumulate for me, yourself and the world.</p>
<p>And, at every stage, obviously assuming no bodily harm, I want you to <strong>try first and ask questions later</strong>. Try things out before talking back. Talk back all you want once you&#8217;ve actually given something a try. So, guy who dismisses SRS out of hand? Idiot. Guy who tries SRS, uses it correctly (in short, frequent bursts, not binges) and still wants out? Smart guy; let him walk his own path.</p>
<p>Head in the general direction of LA first, and<strong> ask for directions not once in one big advice binge, but many times along the way. </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether it&#8217;s a book, a newspaper, or just a tablet computer, I almost always have Chinese literature in hand with me.</p>
<p>And when you do that, you get to meet people who are convinced that they could never become literate.</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t even have to go that far and actually interact with people. To find the most potent source of defeatist opinionation, you need only look inside yourself and the affective states &#8212; emotions &#8212; you create for yourself whenever you come across a word or words you don&#8217;t (yet) know, can&#8217;t (yet) read or can&#8217;t (yet) understand.</p>
<p>Your ignorance. You hate it. Even though your ignorance is actually your friend &#8212; ignorance means there&#8217;s more for you to do. Without ignorance, there would be no novelty, no surprises, no discovery, because you&#8217;d know everything already. Movies and jokes where you know what&#8217;s going to happen are called &#8220;predictable&#8221;, &#8220;trite&#8221; and &#8220;cliched&#8221;. Why? Because you have no <em>ignorance</em>! When someone takes away your ignorance of a movie it&#8217;s called a &#8220;spoiler&#8221;; they&#8217;ve spoiled it &#8212; like rotten food. Ignorance makes the world interesting. Ignorance makes life worth living.</p>
<p>Ignorance is not your enemy. Ignorance is your friend. Your reaction to your own ignorance &#8212; that despair, that self-loathing, and the screw-it-all helplessness they cause &#8212; that&#8217;s your enemy.</p>
<p>The trick to overcoming your ignorance is not to sit around hating yourself. Don&#8217;t hate yourself in general. Free-floating hate is unproductive. Get specific about your hate, get specific about your ignorance. Don&#8217;t hate wo/men, hate that one wo/man. Don&#8217;t hate Japanese people, hate that one guy at the counter &#8212; find out his full name so you can use it as a curse word. Hate is not your problem, sloppiness is your problem, imprecision is your problem.</p>
<p>Hate with precision. Don&#8217;t spread it around. Be stingy. Hate with pinpoint temporal-spatial specificity. <strong>Find a specific quantum of ignorance and erase it and it alone.</strong> Then move on to another quantum. Yeah, there are a lot of words you don&#8217;t know, but you&#8217;ve got to work with <em>one</em> specific word that you don&#8217;t know, <em>not </em>with the fact that &#8220;there are (so) many things I don&#8217;t know&#8221;. That&#8217;s not a useful fact; it&#8217;s not an actionable unit; it&#8217;s not any kind of unit; it&#8217;s just a vague, depressing factoid.</p>
<p>Find a specific quantum of solace I mean ignorance and erase it and it alone. Repeat enough times and you won&#8217;t be ignorant any more. I mean, not cosmically, of course, but in relative terms, you will turn into well-informed awesome sauce. Socially, you may easily become one of the best in the world in your chosen field.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not exaggerating. You seriously will become one of the best, like no one ever was, if only because most people give up without ever even trying. And now you&#8217;re like &#8220;but I done tried already, Khatz, and it didn&#8217;t work&#8221;. Well, try again. There&#8217;s no shame in having to try multiple times. I had to go through RTK multiple times myself, and I kept stumbling and restarting and feeling like a schmuck; it was only Chris Houser and SuperMemo that helped me get through it. Now I&#8217;m literate and people think I&#8217;m smart. I&#8217;m not smart; <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-search-for-the-system-how-i-found-one-why-you-need-one">I&#8217;m systematic &#8212; I use systems, recipes. Not intelligence, not brute force. Systems.</a></p>
<p>Like an employee at McDonald&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t need to be a good cook to make it work; I just <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/popping-bubblewrap-tips-for-better-srs-sentence-items">run through the sequences in the manual, like popping bubblewrap</a>. It&#8217;s like <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-accomplish-great-things-small-victories-winnable-games">when I did janitorial work &#8212; that job was so systematized that a borderline OCD person (me, back then) could come in, get to work, get it right and get it done <em>despite themselves</em></a>. With AJATT, you can go one further: don&#8217;t use learning methods that work despite your faults: use methods that work <em>because</em> of your faults; every bad habit you have can be put to good use.</p>
<p>So&#8230;yeah&#8230;that&#8217;s that story.</p>
<p>Anyway, again, never &#8212; <em>not ever</em> &#8211; deal with the entirety of your ignorance, neither physically (because it&#8217;s impossible) and nor emotionally (because it&#8217;s dangerously counterproductive). Do not acknowledge it, pay it no notice. Focus on one quantum at a time. Digital ignorance (I am ignorant of just this 1 thing), analog knowledge (I&#8217;m pretty awesome all around).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggernaut_(Marvel_Comics)"><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/Juggernaut2.PNG" width="300" height="365" /></a>One is reminded of Juggernaut from <a href="http://is.gd/sJenxu">X-Men 3: The Last Stand</a>.</p>
<p>For a fan of the X-Men comics, the movie version of JG was too small, but that&#8217;s beside the point.</p>
<p>Juggernaut is an unstoppable force. And if time is real, and if time is like Juggernaut &#8212; unstoppable, inexorable in its passage, then perhaps we can hitch a ride on it by &#8212; no, wait, that just makes time seem scary.</p>
<p>No, um&#8230;I dunno. Whatever.</p>
<p>Anyway!</p>
<p>We can be like Juggernaut (what would Juggernaut do?). We become like Juggernaut when we do one active thing at a time. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/what-would-happen-if-you-went-mad-like-sparta-and-started-immersing-like-a-time-vampire-killing-terminator-robot"><strong>Many passive things</strong> &#8212; background immersion counts and works</a> &#8212; <strong>but <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/timeboxing-trilogy-part-1-what-and-why">only ever one active thing</a></strong>. When we calm down, we become powerful. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/gloaf-give-less-of-a-fucare">About which a fark can be given only one thing (or less) at a time can there be.</a></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve never seen someone screaming and shouting and thought: &#8220;what a powerful guy!&#8221;, have you? Losing your head doesn&#8217;t make you powerful, it doesn&#8217;t make you concerned, it doesn&#8217;t make you loving and sincere, it just makes you, well, lost. Incoherent. Energy dispersed and full of crap, like an overflowing toilet. Lacking in the laser-like focus of a magnifying glass, lacking in the narrow, purposeful direction of water in a properly flushing toilet.</p>
<p>A lot of toilet talk today.</p>
<p>Now, take a look at yourself. Do you wanna be powerful? Then <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/calm-down-and-hurry-up">calm down</a>. Read <a href="http://is.gd/maw6Qf">Eckhart Tolle if you must. No, really.</a> His <em>Practicing the Power of Now</em> is one of the most, well, practical books on concentration ever written, and it came right out of the fruity, New Age fringe you so love to hate <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  . It would be bigoted to ignore the things he&#8217;s right about just because you disagree with the things he&#8217;s wrong about&#8230;like not hanging out with a kid because he&#8217;s Greek Orthodox and you&#8217;re Catholic (the correct answer, by the way, is Mormonism). If you&#8217;re old enough to read this, you&#8217;re old enough to pick the bones out of your own books; you shouldn&#8217;t need everything dumbed down and turned into inoffensive, easy-to-chew, easy-to-swallow fillet just so you can &#8220;safely&#8221; consume it; that&#8217;s for babies. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Disclaimer: I eat all my fish boneless because&#8230;I&#8217;m both a wimp and a hypocrite." id="return-note-28945-1" href="#note-28945-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
<p>Relax.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p><strong>One new word a time.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying this because I&#8217;m wise or smart or deep. I am none of those things. But this works. Calming down works. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m sharing this with you.</p>
<p>Of course you can be calm when there&#8217;s nothing to worry about, no readily available ingredients for your worry casserole, but that&#8217;s like saying: &#8220;this building always has running water <em>except</em> when there&#8217;s a fire&#8221;, or &#8220;this room has electric lights running at all times except when it&#8217;s dark outside). It is precisely <em>because</em> everyone else is afraid and in a panic, it is precisely <em>because</em> there are things for you to worry about that you must be clam, I mean, calm <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>
<p>You must be clam!</p>
<p>Haha.</p>
<p>It is precisely <em>because</em> there&#8217;s a fire raging that you must be the water. It is precisely when everything is at its hottest that you must be at your coolest. Panic and pessimism are the only options you cannot afford. You don&#8217;t have time for that. Water only beats fire by being relentless and oblivious to it, not by also turning into fire. In short, by acting just like the fire doesn&#8217;t act, but being the antithesis of fire. Bruce Lee was talking about glasses and Coco-Cola at the time, but he still said it first: be like water, my friend.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/let-go-but-dont-let-go-the-learning-paradox">Thousands of words to learn. The prospect, tall and daunting like a skyscraper</a> in a <a href="http://is.gd/2R6xnp">1970s disaster movie.</a> And then there&#8217;s little old you. Tiny. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/continual-questioning">Will you ever make it? Stupid question. </a>Just start making it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/make-the-process-fit-the-person">If your process sucks, then your life sucks.</a></p>
<p>And if your life sucks, then (get this&#8230;wait for it&#8230;) your <em><strong>life</strong> </em>sucks.</p>
<p>And no milestone can change that.</p>
<p>No milestone will erase day-to-day suckage.</p>
<p>No peak of achievement will make it taste sweet. Not for more than five minutes. Maybe an hour of afterglow. And if you think about it,<strong> it&#8217;s really awful math&#8230;s&#8230;to spend thousands of hours in pain just so you can bask in five minutes of grudgingly given public glory</strong> (which you can&#8217;t even enjoy properly, because success has a hundred far king fathers, so you&#8217;re supposed to act humble and give credit to all the people who helped you along the way in your masochism）.</p>
<p>Or maybe it will; maybe the peak will make it all worth it; I dunno&#8230;many mothers talk about childbirth as having an amnesiac effect, erasing all the pain that went into it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-have-you-been-killing-babies">But I&#8217;m not a mother and your brainchild isn&#8217;t a human baby, although we&#8217;ve previously discussed how it is a metaphorical one</a>. It&#8217;s just a game. It won&#8217;t make you lactate or forget the pain.</p>
<p>Speaking of games&#8230;I have played PlayStation until my thumbs swelled to (I kid you not) twice their normal size, but I did eventually stop when I got my fill of beating my friend, Ngoc, at the boxing game we were playing. And I didn&#8217;t really take the swelling as a badge of honor, just a funny sign that Ngoc and I had played far too much PlayStation that January morning. And I was having fun the whole time, so it didn&#8217;t hurt; the sight of my hands was somewhat alarming, but not painful. Adrenaline, I guess. Did I mention I beat Ngoc at the game? Yeah. Wonned him. Trounced him. In his own house. Multiple times.</p>
<p>And each time I did it, I danced to the game soundtrack and vaguely humped the air, just to make him angry <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>
<p>So <strong>I&#8217;m not saying don&#8217;t go all out, necessarily. I&#8217;m saying&#8230;don&#8217;t suffer.</strong> Not worth it. You won&#8217;t build character: you&#8217;ll just build a track record of suffering. To top it off, you&#8217;ll build a reputation as a sufferer, and people will come to you to suffer for them. So now, you&#8217;re not just suffering for yourself, you&#8217;re the village suffering bicycle and everybody wants a ride. Kind of like how I rode Ngoc at boxing on that PlayStation. Did I mention that I beat him?</p>
<p><strong>Why suffer for 10,000 hours just so you can enjoy 1, when you could enjoy all 10,000?</strong> I mean, are you seeing the exchange rate here? Are you seeing how bad it is? When you trade time away, you are trading life away. Now, unfortunately, you can&#8217;t hoard your surplus time and not trade it, it keeps very badly, but you could <strong>at least make trades that don&#8217;t suck</strong>. Hint: when you get more suffering than joy on the trade, leading experts consider that a bad trade.</p>
<p>Any time spent learning how to make a long-term learning more fun is time well spent because the stakes are so high. Life itself is at stake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/07/goal-planning-for-optimal-enjoyment/">Instead of just having a goal worth having, have a process worth living.</a> That way you win three times: you win at the beginning; you win at the end and you win all through the middle, which is the biggest part.</p>
<p>You can be winning literally the whole time. <a class="simple-footnote" title="There&#8217;s a Charlie Sheen joke somewhere in there; we leave it as an exercise for the reader." id="return-note-29171-1" href="#note-29171-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
<p>And sometimes, all it takes is a mindset change. Here&#8217;s one: <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/there-is-no-end-what-are-you-going-to-do-about-it">don&#8217;t view learning Chinese as a step toward learning Chinese, but as itself a part of already knowing Chinese</a>. To know Chinese is to learn it, is to be learning it; <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/before-fluency-after-fluency">it is not a state; it&#8217;s a series of dynamic state transitions; it is a process, a way of life</a>. And after all, if you started to neglect the language today, you would start sucking today&#8230;Live it, don&#8217;t &#8220;learn&#8221; it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/stop-trying-to-do-things-well-getting-over-zero">Stop trying to do the best possible.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8reIa71Bpw">Just stwop it. Stwop it. Mmmkay?</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not working. You know why I know it&#8217;s not working?<br />
Because if it were working, it&#8217;d be working.</p>
<p>And you wouldn&#8217;t be here.</p>
<p>Stop trying to score metaphorical three-pointers. Just go for the lay-up instead. Go for two instead.</p>
<p>Or &#8212; shoot 10,000 practice balls a week or a month first&#8230;<br />
<em>And then</em> come back and try that surgical strike nonsense.</p>
<p>But <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/aim-to-fail">until you are a surgeon, don&#8217;t do surgery</a>. Do simple, easy, amateur things instead. <a href="http://is.gd/zliDdA">And don&#8217;t do them well. Do them well enough. Like government work.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;But government work is schyte-ballz!&#8221;, you say. No, it isn&#8217;t. Depends on the government. Japanese government work is pretty awesome. It gets done. I can think of <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8A%E3%83%80%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C">some other gubmits that also do good work</a>, and some that <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%A0%E3%83%AF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%BB%E3%82%AD%E3%83%90%E3%82%AD">recently started doing good work</a>. Is it perfect work? No. But since when did you start demanding such ridiculous standards of human beings? If you&#8217;re living in a country where you can read this, your gubmit is prolly doing pretty decent work. Having lived around the world, I notice that one of the differences between a good country and bad one (to live in) isn&#8217;t <em>how well</em> certain things are done but whether they are done <em>at all</em>. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/all-choices-are-binary">It&#8217;s not 1 to 100. It&#8217;s 0 or 1. Binary. And more than 0 is 1.</a></p>
<p>Done at all beats done well. Kinda sorta done beats perfect 0. The only perfection is 0% and 100%. Both tend to be bad for you. In most situations, simply assume you will never reach 100%; you&#8217;ll reach 78%, you may reach 95%.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.antimoon.com/other/myths-mistakesok.htm">Does that mean speak and make mistakes? No</a>. It means don&#8217;t even bother speaking. It means you focus on putting the words in, and let the words come out by themselves. When you don&#8217;t know what something means or how to say something, you look it up.</p>
<p>Stop trying to score holes-in-one. Just move the ball closer to the hole. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/what-golf-can-teach-you-about-getting-used-to-languages">We went from basketball to golf there. Keep up.</a></p>

<p>Why <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/quantity-always-trumps-quality/">pile up mediocrity?</a></p>
<p>Because <strong><a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/quantity-always-trumps-quality/">a pile of mediocrity isn&#8217;t mediocre</a>. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/quantity-time-is-quality-time">Mediocrity accumulated is transcendent</a>.</strong> Perfectionism is the siren path to nowhere but pain and perdition. And even excellence is not the path to excellence. You don&#8217;t get to excellence by being excellent, you get to excellence by moving. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/mediocre-excellence">Mediocrity is the path to excellence.</a> I would even go so far as to say that it is the only path(set) worth your consideration because, while all paths may end in death, this one doesn&#8217;t contain death. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-have-you-been-killing-babies">People who are willing to shrug off mistakes don&#8217;t kill themselves.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://is.gd/DpAjPo">Just because we can conceptualize perfection, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a good idea</a>. It&#8217;s an idea that needs to go. Lest you think this is age mellowing me out and softening me up, it&#8217;s not (not that mellowing out wouldn&#8217;t be a good thing for me &#8212; it totally would). Perceptions notwithstanding, it is only this kind of mellowness that even makes the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/all-in-moderation">apparent extremeness of AJATT</a> possible (trivial example: if you&#8217;re going to be doing Japanese all the time, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/be-a-bum">you can&#8217;t be choosy about its &#8220;quality&#8221; or difficulty or &#8220;educationalness&#8221;</a>). <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/there-is-no-end-what-are-you-going-to-do-about-it">I had to mellow out to get here in the first place, and I have to mellow out to stay &#8220;here&#8221;</a>. AJATT may be a <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/what-would-happen-if-you-went-mad-like-sparta-and-started-immersing-like-a-time-vampire-killing-terminator-robot">hot-headed philosophy</a>, but it&#8217;s very much a controlled heat: it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/boiling-water">stoves</a> and <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-anchors">pilot lights</a>, not fire and brimstone.</p>
<p>Verily, I say unto you, <strong><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/dont-start-clean-start-dirty-why-a-clean-slate-is-bad-for-you-and-what-to-do-about-it">it was the <em>rejection</em> of perfection that led me to such great heights so fast in Japanese</a></strong>, that took me out of &#8220;100 kanji hell&#8221; and to an imperfect knowledge of thousands of kanji. It is the rejection of perfection that created and keeps this site alive, because if I&#8217;d insisted on perfect (which is what I wanted), it&#8217;d be either undone or deleted, like so many great websites of friends, acquaintances and strangers, like so many unwritten books that are being &#8220;worked on&#8221;; I see many of these and I want to scream: &#8220;Let it out! Let it go! Let it be mediocre!&#8221;</p>
<p>What about Apple? What about the iPhone? Wasn&#8217;t Steve Jobs a perfectionist? Didn&#8217;t perfectionism in his work kill him (it was prolly <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/naughty-nutrition/201201/ivegetarian-the-high-fructose-diet-steve-jobs">perfectionism in his diet</a>, but we&#8217;ll leave that argument to the experts and <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/02/11/all-fruit-diet.aspx">people willing to court controversy</a>) &#8212; but also lead to perfect devices?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, &#8217;cause no SD card slot, no Ethernet port, iTunes music transfer so bad it made me get an Android Sony Walkman for mp3s, and constant upgrade/connectivity issues? Real perfect.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: I love my iOS devices and they&#8217;ve changed my life &#8212; the iPad is the only ereader that really seems get the job done for me, not any of the Kindles, not the Surface, not any Android tablet (their touchscreens are just too unreliable; software UIs too fiddly) &#8212; they allow me to be an avid reader without the burden of lugging books across the planet (or being forced into sedentarism in order to be near my books). But they&#8217;re not perfect, never have been and never will be. <a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/2011/05/protopia/">No doubt they&#8217;ll improve, though. Protopia not utopia, and all that.</a></p>
<p>The only reason there are new things is because old things can be improved. And the reason they can be improved is because they have things that sucked about them. Everything human beings have ever made &#8212; and many things we didn&#8217;t &#8212; has something that sucks about it. And the reason why is because that&#8217;s all we can do in <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-do-people-who-have-all-the-time-in-the-world-get-nothing-done">finite time</a> &#8212; produce things that are imperfect, that are <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/1-is-bigger-than-0">better than nothing</a>. As Dan S. Kennedy often says, the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/birthlines-part-1-what-is-a-birthline">deadline</a> is the greatest of all human inventions, because it made all other inventions possible.</p>
<p>Sure, if we had infinite time we might do infinitely well &#8212; perfectly. But that would also mean things would take infinitely long. And <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/do-something-easy-or-nothing-at-all-there-is-no-hard">so, quite literally, nothing would ever get done or made. And that&#8217;s exactly where perfectionism leads: to nothing and nowhere.</a></p>
<p>Show me a failed author and I&#8217;ll show you someone who tries to write masterpieces, instead of just writing. Show me a failed programmer and I&#8217;ll show you someone who tries to write good programs, instead of ones just work. Show me a failed salesman and I&#8217;ll show you someone who tries to break sales records instead of just prospecting. <a href="http://is.gd/MC7FQM">Stephen King writes like a factory worker, man.

<p>Our universe is made up of pieces so small that they do not matter. They&#8217;re not even mediocre. They&#8217;re sub-microscopic and sub-mediocre.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The point of eating food is not simply to get full. The point of learning a language is not simply to memorize a really big vocabulary, or even to get good at the language.</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately, it is for most people. But there&#8217;s a Japanese aphorism (don&#8217;t act like you didn&#8217;t see that coming) that perfectly encapsulates the optimal behavior path in this situation:</p>
<p>急がば回れ。<br />
If you&#8217;re in a rush, take the scenic route.</p>
<p>Getting good is good. Those things are all good. It&#8217;s nice to be full and it&#8217;s nice to have a big vocabulary. It&#8217;s just that <strong>you&#8217;re more likely to eat more if you focus more or less totally on making and procuring <em>tasty</em> food than &#8220;efficient&#8221;, &#8220;filling&#8221; food.</strong> Similarly, if you focus just about exclusively on having fun <em>through</em> the language, <em>while</em> you still suck, <em>while</em> you&#8217;re not full yet, you&#8217;ll naturally &#8220;eat&#8221; more of it, and eat more often, and naturally get &#8220;fuller&#8221; faster.</p>
<p>Sure, you could simply bloat yourself with water, vitamin pills and rice or Calorie Mate (another Japanese thing) and call it a day. And that would get you full and it would be fast. And sad and depressing. So much so that you&#8217;d probably just go hungry most of the time. And yet, this is exactly how most smart, diligent, conscientious people approach languages &#8212; vocabulary lists, classes, boring words first and last&#8230;anything but something real and funny. And they, too, metaphorically starve to death.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in a rush, take the scenic route. Have fun at now, not later &#8212; there won&#8217;t <em>be</em> a later with that kind of suffering &#8211;  one tasty bite or footstep at a time.</p>

And it struck me how interesting it was that her philosophy came to be embodied in&#8230;]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, big Ayn Rand <a class="simple-footnote" title="To tell you the truth, I knew literally nothing about her until an AJATTeer mentioned her because I once wrote a blog post that had a title that was eerily similar to that of one of her later non-fiction books. Since I don&#8217;t like reading fiction (except comic books and sci-fi short stories, and Asimov&#8217;s Foundation, which reads like a short story), I read the Cliffs&#8217; Notes of her novels, then read her non-fiction directly. But she did say a lot of cool stuff. And a lot of nonsense, too: she was a woman I mean human being after all   . Oh, you chicks like it, don&#8217;t act like you don&#8217;t like it." id="return-note-28725-1" href="#note-28725-1"><sup>1</sup></a> fan here. Big. Bulbous. I&#8217;ve worn out many a pillow fantasizing over that woman.</p>
<p>No, seriously, though, I just got done reading a couple of the new Ayn Rand bios that came out&#8230;what&#8230;the other year? And it struck me how interesting it was that her philosophy came to be embodied in an organization &#8212; a collective, a group &#8212; that negated the very values it espoused.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s even more ironic is that the group dynamics of the self-parodically named Rand Objectivist &#8220;Collective&#8221; functioned exactly like those of Left Wing extremists (i.e. Communists/Marxists) in Japan [famously reconstructed in the movie "光の雨"] and elsewhere &#8212; down to show trials and excommunication. All that didn&#8217;t happen in Rand&#8217;s case was people getting physically beaten and/or killed, they just got yelled at a lot, and people who didn&#8217;t go to boarding school are surprising fragile in the face of verbal abuse. I&#8217;m telling you, go to boarding school, you will not give a ###k. Actually, that&#8217;s probably not universally true; I crumble quite neatly when scolded.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not done yet. This is the Internet and so Godwin&#8217;s Law applies. What&#8217;s even more ironic is that the Nazi military (or, the German military under the Nazis), the Wehrmacht or whatever they insisted on calling themselves instead of using a perfectly Germanic English name, for reasons of expediency, became really ethnically diverse in its recruiting. Think about it: an army built around a belief system so rigid that not even Russians were blond enough to escape its wrath&#8230;ended up looking suspiciously like a United Colors of Benetton ad.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got to love the contradictions and object-lesson-like paradoxes of history; if you wrote some of this stuff as fiction, nobody would believe you.</p>
<p>OK, so&#8230;today&#8217;s lesson, kids, is this:</p>
<p><strong>AJATT can and, left unattended, will become a cult or cult-like if you follow it to the letter (and humor alone will not save the day).</strong> You don&#8217;t have to be a male genital organ about it, but never withdraw your right to give me, or any idea I share with you, the figurative finger. More importantly, never stop reading other people&#8217;s ideas, many of which will be bad and bad for you, yes, but some of which will be good. In a way, the cure for bad information is more information, especially random, weird, outside-the-&#8221;outside-the-box&#8221;-box, serendipity-prone information. That is, not merely an increase in information quantity (which, by itself, actually starts to be bad for you relatively quickly), but an increase in the number of different qualities of information &#8212; the spread, if you will&#8230;basically, ecleticism.</p>
<p>Ayn Rand didn&#8217;t herself develop a cultus, but she did permit it to grow and, not being a man, she was ungentlemanly to her inner circle. Oh, zing. No, women and minorities are great. (Also, to be fair, she was tired of getting trolled by the both sides of the political spectrum, so she enjoyed the safe space; it really is a shame, because she and Hayek and Friedman should have been BFFs, but instead she was kinda isolated from them. In fact, if you think about it, Rand got trolled for almost every major thing she ever was, did or believed: trolled for being Jewish, trolled for her father&#8217;s economic success, trolled for thinking capitalism is a good idea, trolled for her absence of religious belief&#8230;).</p>
<p>Anyway, for real, though, this is yet another <strong>irony of many groups and organizations: </strong>not only do<strong> they rapidly violate their own central dogma</strong>, but it&#8217;s almost never the top person that turns them cultish, it&#8217;s the <em>followers</em>, usually led by a lieutenant of some kind. <strong>Rules are enforced top-down, but the demand for rules in the first place is almost a always bottom-up phenomenon.</strong> Think of your friend who&#8217;s always going: &#8220;there should be a law/for against that&#8230;&#8221; without engaging her second-order thinking to realize that the morass of existing laws, enforced and unenforced, is part of the problem to begin with.</p>
<p>Money, of which I am also a fan, is valuable because we believe in it. Similarly, cults are cultish because people, the followers, the underlings, insist on giving up their autonomy; they demand it; they <em>demand</em> rigidity, calling it &#8220;structure&#8221; and &#8220;discipline&#8221;; they demand that their freedom and dignity be taken away &#8212; and if you can&#8217;t take these away from them, they&#8217;re gonna go find someplace that will. They want that stern, tough, &#8220;fatherly&#8221; love and if you don&#8217;t convincingly give it to them (passing their &#8220;crap-tests&#8221; of your resolve), they will find someone that does.</p>
<p>You see it everywhere. A friend of a guy I read a lot of, once said (and I paraphrase): &#8220;after birth, most human beings spend their lives looking for a new place to plug in their umbilical cord&#8221;.</p>
<p>You see it everywhere. That&#8217;s why hardcore sects are more lastingly popular than loosey-goosey ones. <a class="simple-footnote" title="So, for example, shooting in the dark, without looking at actual stats to check this out, I would bet that Reform Judaism, on the whole, for most people, will probably never be any more than a transition phase out to full-blown secularism or into various levels of deeper orthodoxy; anecdotally, it seems that even non-believing Jewish people find orthodox practice more fulfilling. Ditto for Unitarianism.
It&#8217;s often suggested that Rand was a moral absolutist because, ultimately, she was culturally Russian &#8212; thus grim, verbose and melancholy &#8212; and had no grasp of Anglo-Saxon humor and negotiated compromise of the kind that brought about constitutional monarchy in the UK. I call BS on that. First of all, England&#8217;s king was beheaded, too. Secondly, human beings in general hate middle ground because it feels too shaky. And it doesn&#8217;t stir the blood; it doesn&#8217;t inspire. Case in point: &#8220;All Japanese All The Time&#8221; is a misnomer, but &#8220;Some Japanese All The Time&#8221; or &#8220;Plenty of Japanese, Young Man!&#8221; just&#8230;yeah. Human beings only ever settle on middle ground out of fatigue.
More cases in point: Mormons hate &#8220;moral relativism&#8221; much more then they hate Baptists; Baptists hate Mormons for &#8220;not being Christians&#8221; much more than they hate Buddhists and Muslims for &#8220;not being Christians&#8221;; people hate what is closer much more than what is far away &#8212; during the Troubles, Catholic and Protestant Northern Irelanders would fight each other long before they&#8217;d fight Japanese people. Mac and PC people hate each other more than they hate people who don&#8217;t use computers at all.
People hate what is closer much more than what is far away. And so middle ground is hated because it is also close. So close, but so far. A bisexual girl-friend of mine tells me that many lesbians she meets actively dislike bi-girls for being &#8220;traitors&#8221; and &#8220;not picking a side&#8221;." id="return-note-28725-2" href="#note-28725-2"><sup>2</sup></a> It&#8217;s sort of like BDSM (betcha didn&#8217;t see that coming!); M especially. A lot of people can&#8217;t seem to get their (morality) fix if someone isn&#8217;t giving it to them hard; it has to hurt for it to feel good to them. You see the same in medicine and exercise; many people <em>like </em>painful workouts and side-effect-laden medications; nothing else feels &#8220;real&#8221;.</p>
<p>You see it everywhere. Kids who loudly and openly rebel often <em>want </em>someone to come down hard on them: if they didn&#8217;t want that, they&#8217;d just go have their fun quietly. One can drink, drug, hump and cut school very discretely without drawing attention to oneself if one so chooses.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m no different, really. I jump from one conviction (in a method or theory of set of ideas) to the next. And that certainty that mental frameworks &#8212; &#8220;thought systems&#8221; &#8212; can provide is like a security blanket; there you are, all wrapped in a warm tortilla, heated by the zeal of a convert. But I think that that may be key &#8212; the jumping part. Perhaps you want to be a true believer long enough and deep enough to benefit from (and empirically test) the ideas, but not so long that you are damaged by them and lose your autonomy for real.</p>
<p>Externally imposed (and thus coercive) information control of any kind, from any source, I think, is the big red flag. Never let anyone, friend, family or troll, force you to read or not read anything &#8212; and they will try if you let them; they so effing will; the areligious fundamentalists (of which the Communists were one type) will do it; the religious fundamentalists will do it; your hockey buddies will do it; your effing book club will do it; they (or some subset of them) will attempt to mock, browbeat or actually just beat you into reading or not reading what they want. And you must never, ever give in. Not for one moment. <strong>Control of your body is imprisonment; control of your mind is slavery.</strong> So, perhaps in all things, but especially in your reading list, by all means take suggestions, take advice, but not orders, especially not exclusionary orders.</p>
<p>Like, I think it was some Swedish guy who once said: people talk a lot about freedom of speech and exercising it, but the real freedom that is in danger (and rarely exercised) is freedom of thought.</p>
<p>Control of your body is imprisonment; control of your mind is slavery.</p>
<p>Obviously, some information is bad for you. We know reading the news is bad for you. But it&#8217;s one thing for you to choose, freely, to not read the news, and another thing altogether for someone to force that upon you and block your access to it. It&#8217;s one thing for you to choose to go to bed early and another thing for a boarding school to use force and lighting arrangements to <em>make</em> you bed early. The result looks similar but it&#8217;s totally different on the inside; it&#8217;s like the difference between healthy-slim people and eating-disorder-slim people: they can look the same, but they are totally different on the inside.</p>
<p>Jon Biesnecker called it the Tyranny of a Single Source of Information. And this is perhaps the worst and most common form of tyranny in the world today. It&#8217;s the worst because schools promote it and schools are common, so it seems &#8220;normal&#8221;; it seems asymptomatic, thus making it difficult to detect.</p>
<p>The AJATT method, and any other method, must not be your only source. For two reasons:</p>
<p>1) Actual Bad Information: The things that I&#8217;m wrong about<br />
a) The things that don&#8217;t work for you<br />
b) The things that I didn&#8217;t know about when writing<br />
2) Omissions of Good, Qualifying, Contextual Information: The things that I&#8217;m right about, but take for granted when writing and so neglect to spell out; these are things that would qualify and clarify statements that, lacking qualification and clarification, you (rightly) misconstrue.</p>
<p>(1) is obvious. (2) is the reason dots fail to connect. (2) is the reason why so many people have trouble with mathematics in school &#8212; skipped steps, suppressed premises, gaps in logic that appeared self-evident to the instructor. (2) is the reason people spin their wheels &#8212; working hard, suffering and getting nowhere.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s bring it back down to language-learning: <strong>maybe pick up a textbook from time to time. Do it. You might even learn something.</strong> That&#8217;s not sarcasm, by the way. As anti-textbook as AJATT (justifiably) is, it is for this very reason that you need to pick up a textbook now and then, just to shake things up a little. To show you what sucks and to help you as well, because <strong>no one is immune to good ideas. And no one is immune to bad ones either</strong>. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Indeed, everything you&#8217;ve just read might be completely wrong. From immunology, for example, we learn that weaker diseases &#8212; that spread fast but do not kill &#8212; stick around longer; killing your hosts isn&#8217;t smart. Similarly, it&#8217;s been suggested, within the now-unpopular (and even, it seems, semi-discredited?) field of memetics, that cults need to strike a balance between strictness and mass suicide.
OK, screw all this big talk. We&#8217;re not going to come to any conclusions here; we&#8217;re not going to make the Good Society by dinnertime tomorrow (although we do have plenty of Good Enough Societies around the world already) because we, as a species, haven&#8217;t quite yet figured out how to do it (or how to do it and keep it safe and stable long enough to not get overrun and lost to history) yet.
PS: I didn&#8217;t get into it here, but groups explicitly built around philosophies and ideas are not the only ones subject to dynamics that are antithetical to all their core beliefs and purposes. It happens in, of all places, ostensibly for-profit companies all the time, and with stunning regularity. There&#8217;s no logical reason that any large company should fail to turn a profit; there&#8217;s no shortage of manpower or smart ideas. That, then, leaves the illogical reasons: companies fail make money because they spend the better part of their time and energy doing things that don&#8217;t make money and forcibly disallowing things that do.
PPS: Don&#8217;t even get me started about what educational institutions do to learning&#8230;
PPPS: If you want a book that&#8217;s got smart science, smart economics, smart sociology, no dogma and no utopianism &#8212; Rand without the fat and bitterness, Hayek without economese &#8212; try Matt Ridley&#8217;s &#8220;The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves&#8221;." id="return-note-28725-3" href="#note-28725-3"><sup>3</sup></a>
<div class="simple-footnotes"><p class="notes">Notes:</p><ol><li id="note-28725-1">To tell you the truth, I knew literally nothing about her until an AJATTeer mentioned her because I once wrote a blog post that had a title that was eerily similar to that of one of her later non-fiction books. Since I don&#8217;t like reading fiction (except comic books and sci-fi short stories, and Asimov&#8217;s <em>Foundation</em>, which reads like a short story), I read the Cliffs&#8217; Notes of her novels, then read her non-fiction directly. But she did say a lot of cool stuff. And a lot of nonsense, too: she was a woman I mean human being after all <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />  . Oh, you chicks like it, don&#8217;t act like you don&#8217;t like it.</p>
 <a href="#return-note-28725-1">&#8617;</a></li><li id="note-28725-2">So, for example, shooting in the dark, without looking at actual stats to check this out, I would bet that Reform Judaism, on the whole, for most people, will probably never be any more than a transition phase out to full-blown secularism or into various levels of deeper orthodoxy; anecdotally, it seems that even non-believing Jewish people find orthodox practice more fulfilling. Ditto for Unitarianism.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s often suggested that Rand was a moral absolutist because, ultimately, she was culturally Russian &#8212; thus grim, verbose and melancholy &#8212; and had no grasp of Anglo-Saxon humor and negotiated compromise of the kind that brought about constitutional monarchy in the UK. I call BS on that. First of all, England&#8217;s king was beheaded, too. Secondly, human beings in general hate middle ground because it feels too shaky. And it doesn&#8217;t stir the blood; it doesn&#8217;t inspire. Case in point: &#8220;All Japanese All The Time&#8221; is a misnomer, but &#8220;Some Japanese All The Time&#8221; or &#8220;Plenty of Japanese, Young Man!&#8221; just&#8230;yeah. Human beings only ever settle on middle ground out of fatigue.</p>
<p>More cases in point: Mormons hate &#8220;moral relativism&#8221; much more then they hate Baptists; Baptists hate Mormons for &#8220;not being Christians&#8221; much more than they hate Buddhists and Muslims for &#8220;not being Christians&#8221;; people hate what is closer much more than what is far away &#8212; during the Troubles, Catholic and Protestant Northern Irelanders would fight each other long before they&#8217;d fight Japanese people. Mac and PC people hate each other more than they hate people who don&#8217;t use computers at all.</p>
<p>People hate what is closer much more than what is far away. And so middle ground is hated because it is also close. So close, but so far. A bisexual girl-friend of mine tells me that many lesbians she meets actively dislike bi-girls for being &#8220;traitors&#8221; and &#8220;not picking a side&#8221;. <a href="#return-note-28725-2">&#8617;</a></li><li id="note-28725-3">Indeed, everything you&#8217;ve just read might be completely wrong.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a couple of life tips for ya. Free of charge.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t ask non-thin people how to get thin.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t ask non-rich people how to get rich.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t ask illiterate people how to learn to read.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because they <em>will</em> give you advice and it <em>will</em> suck. It&#8217;s always flattering to be asked for advice and few can resist <a class="simple-footnote" title="I certainly can&#8217;t&#8230;won&#8217;t&#8230;don&#8217;t; if you ask me advice, I&#8217;ll give ya some &#8212; competence be damned." id="return-note-28593-1" href="#note-28593-1"><sup>1</sup></a> the temptation to wax philosophical in areas far outside those of their expertise.</p>
<p>By asking English speakers who have not yet learned how to read Japanese&#8230;how to read Japanese, you&#8217;re essentially asking Paula Deen how to cook without butter and sugar. You&#8217;re asking Lindsay Lohan how to control your drinking. You&#8217;re asking that guy who can&#8217;t read good&#8230;how to read well. You&#8217;re asking Eeyore how to be charismatic &#8212; how to be happy and not talk in a monotone.</p>
<p>For your own sake, try not to do that. Just&#8230;try. For me. Do it for me. Try not to ask Patrick Stewart how to be a successful YouTuber. Because, he&#8217;s a great guy, but he doesn&#8217;t duck hen know.</p>
<p>If you want to know how to succeed at something, ask people who&#8217;ve succeeded at it. You wouldn&#8217;t deliberately choose an incompetent doctor to heal you. So why do you choose obviously, <em>demonstrably</em> incompetent people to help you solve problems they themselves have <em>clearly</em> failed to solve?</p>
<p>I mean, come on. You realize your chances at throwing a question on a free forum on the Internet and having a cool, competent, well-adjusted person answer it are painfully slim, right? Slimmer on some subjects than others. You wouldn&#8217;t just pick up a free couch on the street because, well, it might contain bed bugs. Maybe it got peed on. Maybe ugly people had sex on it. But you&#8217;ll pick up free, pee-soaked ideas and put them into your mind, just like that?</p>
<p>Rully?</p>
<p>Let me tell you something about human beings. When they get good at something, they like to get compensated for it. Doctors don&#8217;t spend their youth reading thick books and not sleeping and buying state-of-the-art gear for their practices just so they can not get paid. So, simply by riding the free advice train, you&#8217;re already putting yourself at great risk. You&#8217;ve saved a buck or two on buying a book, but you&#8217;re paying through the nose for the privilege. To be fair, though, there aren&#8217;t that many good books on how to get used to Japanese, so&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t seriously try to diagnose and treat an illness using Wikipedia and WebMD, would you? Just because you&#8217;re sick, doesn&#8217;t mean any medicine will do. You could hurt yourself, put yourself in a worse position by just ingesting pills and FUD willy-nilly. Sort of a reverse Hippocratic oath.</p>
<p><strong>Bad advice can and will hurt you as badly as any chemical you could ingest</strong>. Bad advice is a killer of dreams, of progress and even of bodies. Bad advice will take you from the stars to the gutter. So&#8230;<span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>stop swallowing mental pills from random strangers.</strong></span></p>
<p>Including me. Don&#8217;t listen to me. Give me the finger. Mutter cursewords at me. I would rather you did that &#8212; I would rather you retreat into your own mind and listen to yourself &#8212; than just go taking free Internet advice. I would rather you go wrong in freedom than go wrong in thrall to conventional wisdom <a class="simple-footnote" title="AKA stupid (but reasonable-sounding) advice from stupid (but reasonable-sounding) people" id="return-note-28593-2" href="#note-28593-2"><sup>2</sup></a>. If that&#8217;s what it takes, I will take one for the team: Team You.</p>
<p>Because, dayom. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Lambs to the far Ken slaughter, man.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Failure has nothing to teach you. Don&#8217;t learn from your mistakes.</p>
<p>There is one and only one bit of useful, reliable information you can safely glean from failure: &#8220;<em>that</em> didn&#8217;t work&#8221;. Which is wonderful, because now you know to consider maybe not doing <em>that</em> any more. But that&#8217;s all you get in terms of valuable, actionable, safe information.</p>
<p>Nothing more.</p>
<p>In most cases, everything else is useless, or (worse) emotionally damaging. Any attempt to learn more from failure than that &#8220;that didn&#8217;t work&#8221; will thus only lead to more unnecessary pain and failure. Failure contains other information, but that&#8217;s a mineshaft just waiting to collapse on whoever goes down it.</p>
<p>What good will it do you to know how <em>not</em> to do something correctly? The infinite number of wrong ways? None at all.</p>
<p>Again, there are exceptions <a class="simple-footnote" title="The airline industry does an amazing job of learning from its mistakes, and air travel keeps getting safer and safer even as more and more people travel. What I think this shows is that cool, detached, dispassionate, disinterested third parties can learn from mistakes just fine, but active participants are best off not poking at them too much." id="return-note-28566-1" href="#note-28566-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, but none of them apply to you. In general, failure is like stool. Both are thoroughly acceptable, perhaps even essential, by-products of processes. There is a great deal we could potentially learn from our stool as individuals, and I look forward to the day when our home toilets analyze it for us. But it&#8217;s not safe to just go handling human solid waste with your bare hands. There&#8217;s a reason we&#8217;re grossed out by it; there&#8217;s a reason we want to get and keep it far away from us. Absent the correct tools and expertise, you&#8217;re better off not handling your stool. Let someone else do it. That, or just flush it away. Get rid of it.</p>
<p><strong>You learn from your successes.</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what impression you get from me as a person from reading my writing, but I am afraid. Of almost everything. Afraid of talking to people, afraid of offending people, and even afraid of writing&#8230;if I could curl up in a little ball and never have to interact with human beings again, I would actually do that. One day I might <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  . The weird thing is that I also like hanging out and parties. It doesn&#8217;t make much sense.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/aim-to-fail">Much is made of the role of numerically massive, small, cheap failure in massive success. I&#8217;ve written about it rather excitedly myself. And I stand by what I wrote &#8212; because it&#8217;s true</a>. <a class="simple-footnote" title="I remain deeply inspired by the exam strategy of this one kid who shared his story on Facebook: he got through college trying to fail exams &#8212; aiming to fail." id="return-note-28566-2" href="#note-28566-2"><sup>2</sup></a> If you want to succeed, to become &#8220;a success&#8221;, to achieve mastery, then <strong>you need to fail more times than Joe Blow has <em>tried</em></strong>; that is the arithmetic of success and it still stands. There is, however, a little misconception to clear up, namely the idea that you somehow learn directly from the failure. &#8220;Learn from your mistakes&#8221; and all that. Well, that&#8217;s a lie. You don&#8217;t. You can&#8217;t. Most people can&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too raw and painful to learn from mistakes. I&#8217;ve tried. It doesn&#8217;t work. It just makes you over-cautious and more error-prone. Not to mention, how are you supposed to learn from a mistake, really? I mean, it&#8217;s a mistake &#8212; by definition, it contains erroneous information. Somehow you&#8217;re supposed to dig in there and find gold? Not likely.</p>
<p><strong>Learning from failure is like trying to learn how to spell correctly by looking at typos.</strong> You could read whole books of typos, stately tomes of copious error written by dyslexic six-year-olds; it&#8217;d amuse you&#8230;wouldn&#8217;t help that spelling, though. This is why, by the way, I hate language books that show you common errors, especially the ones that show you errors first, as some Japanese <em>keigo</em> (敬語) guides are wont to do, although they are by no means alone in this crime.</p>
<p>By the primary-recency principle <a class="simple-footnote" title="of memory" id="return-note-28566-3" href="#note-28566-3"><sup>3</sup></a> alone, showing someone the wrong way to do something is the perfect way to get them to do it wrong. One time, back in high school, our pinko <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  history teacher spent like half an hour haranguing us<em> </em>on the evils of confusing &#8220;provincial&#8221; with &#8220;provisional&#8221; (as in &#8220;Provisional Government&#8221; and &#8220;Provincial Government&#8221; &#8212; Bolshevik revolution and all that). Being an avid dictionary reader from an early age, I always <a class="simple-footnote" title="well, not always; I was born illiterate just like we all are." id="return-note-28566-4" href="#note-28566-4"><sup>4</sup></a> had a relatively large vocabulary; if nothing else, I had never confused the words &#8220;provincial&#8221; and &#8220;provisional&#8221; &#8212; not even once. Guess what I starting doing though?</p>
<p>Learning from failure is like trying to learn how to cook good food by forcing yourself to eat bad food &#8212; painful, unnecessary and dubious in its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Learning from failure is like trying to learn how to be clean by being dirty. It&#8217;s bass ackwards.</p>
<p>Learning from failure is like trying to learn how to dance like Michael Jackson by studying everything except dance and Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>Learning from failure is like trying to get to your friend&#8217;s house by learning how to get to everybody but your friend&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>Maybe it &#8220;builds character&#8221; (whatever that means &#8212; I think it&#8217;s grownupese for &#8220;busywork that is not only boring but also emotionally painful&#8221;) but it doesn&#8217;t really help.</p>
<p><strong>You don&#8217;t learn from failure, you learn <em>around</em> it. You bounce <em>off</em> it. You put it behind you. Because it&#8217;s just&#8230; churn.</strong> It&#8217;s a byproduct, like sawdust from cutting up timber or scraps of paper left over from wrapping up gifts. So there can be a lot of it, and you should be fine making lots of it &#8212; like egg shells to your omelette&#8230;it&#8217;s not a big deal. You just chuck it away and move on. <strong>You make the mistakes in large number, but you also discard them&#8230;in large number.</strong> There&#8217;s a reason why dumpsters are so big&#8230; <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Fire and forget. The only &#8220;lesson&#8221; in a failure is in the fact that a mistake was made, not in the content of the mistake. Nothing to see here. Move on. Take the next shot. Bullets are cheap (or should be, if you want to learn to shoot well).</p>
<p><strong>You learn from success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any success. Of any apparent size. In your own life, or in someone else&#8217;s.</strong></p>
<p>And they&#8217;re there. No matter how much of a screw-up you may think you are, you&#8217;ve got something good going on. You&#8217;ve got something that you&#8217;re amazing at. That you&#8217;re really good at. Right now. You have achieved mastery at it already. There&#8217;s a system that you&#8217;ve got working. It&#8217;s a thing of beauty. It puts Swiss clockwork to shame. And you did it. You do it. With astonishing regularity.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s how you make burritos to repeated perfection. Maybe it&#8217;s the way you do your hair. Maybe it&#8217;s how you make your bed <a class="simple-footnote" title="Yeah. That small. But success is success. Don&#8217;t knock it. Don&#8217;t knock the atoms of success. Matter is made of atoms after all." id="return-note-28566-5" href="#note-28566-5"><sup>5</sup></a>. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Now, you probably don&#8217;t think this thing (or things) that you&#8217;re doing well are a big deal. That&#8217;s where you&#8217;re gravely mistaken. It probably won&#8217;t make the 9-o&#8217;-clock news, but you should take that as a compliment more than anything else. One success is the kernel for all success: the basic pattern is the same &#8212; if, that is, you&#8217;ll simply allow yourself to see it.</p>
<p>Simple and obvious example: You have learned and maintained at least one language really well already. In fact, you&#8217;re learning and maintaining it right now. This is your success pattern, if you&#8217;ll allow yourself to see it that way.</p>
<p>The problem with most people is that they don&#8217;t allow themselves to see it. Their misplaced modesty prevents them from seeing their own successes as successes. And as for the success of other people, they treat other people like morally superior creatures from another dimension, with whom they have nothing to do and from whom they have nothing to learn. &#8220;That&#8217;s fine for him, but he had talent; I&#8217;m a screw-up&#8221;.</p>
<p>What a terrible thing to think and say about yourself. I can&#8217;t really think of anything clever to say to that. So I&#8217;ll just say this:<strong> it doesn&#8217;t take any real intelligence to find all the ways that other people&#8217;s successful examples <em>don&#8217;t</em> apply to you</strong> (and it doesn&#8217;t get you anywhere pleasant either; it&#8217;ll get you places, just not places you&#8217;ll enjoy going or being). The real intelligence is in finding out how they <em>do</em> (apply to you), in finding the similarities, in finding ways to replicate the successful example in a way that suits you and your particular situation.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what will allow you to see how the methods that kids from Poland used to learn English could at least potentially apply to kids from wherever you&#8217;re from learning Japanese.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/baking-cookies">In a way, it call comes back to baking cookies. Of course you&#8217;re out of nutmeg, but that doesn&#8217;t instantly invalidate the recipe, your life and your chances at homemade cookies today. </a>The Goody Two Shoes response is to give up like a freaking von Neumann computer because of one little semicolon. The human Bad Boy response is to forge your own cookie path, nutmeg or no nutmeg.</p>
<p><strong>You learn from success. And it doesn&#8217;t even have to be your success or the success at the exact same thing</strong> (arguably, at a fundamental level, no two things are truly the exact same anyhow, so&#8230;everything is already an analogy&#8230;Pauli Exclusion Principle and all that)</p>
<p>You see, a success you can learn from. A success is full of information that is correct.<strong> Even the parts of a success that are &#8220;incorrect&#8221; are &#8220;correct&#8221; in that they at least didn&#8217;t prevent the success from occurring.</strong> You can&#8217;t say that about a failure; <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>you can&#8217;t safely parse a failure for the good bits</strong></span> <a class="simple-footnote" title="(again &#8212; too error-prone, too emotionally wrenching)" id="return-note-28566-6" href="#note-28566-6"><sup>6</sup></a> any more than you can safely pick tomatoes out of your stool for use in another sandwich. A success, on the other hand, went right. It&#8217;s something you want. It&#8217;s correct spelling. It&#8217;s moonwalking. You want to imitate and duplicate and replicate and mass-produce it. You want to repeat it. You want it to happen again. You want to be able to do it again.</p>
<p>So go. Look at that success and others. See what the parts are. See how they move. See how you can make it happen again.</p>
<p>Will it always work? Will this process always work? Right out the box? On the first go? Ironically enough, no. That&#8217;s part of the fun, though &#8212; tweaking it until it does work just the way you want it. At worst, you&#8217;ll just produce some more sawdust. But that&#8217;s cool &#8212; only mills that aren&#8217;t working&#8230;don&#8217;t produce sawdust.</p>
<p>And maybe you can go one better and turn your sawdust into <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%91%E3%83%BC%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AB%E3%83%9C%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89">particle board</a>: now you&#8217;re not simply recovering from failure, you&#8217;re <em>profitting</em> from it (hint: way better than &#8220;learning&#8221;&#8230;geez), which is exactly the kind of thing you want to be doing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/1-is-bigger-than-0">Difference matters more than distance.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/1-is-bigger-than-0">The distance between nothing and something is small.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/1-is-bigger-than-0">But the difference is infinite.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Cause snobs&#8221; often talk about making a difference. They&#8217;re especially fond of overly combative, guilt-inducing statements like: &#8220;if you&#8217;re not part of the solution, part you&#8217;re part of the problem&#8221;.</p>
<p>Arguably, they&#8217;re right. And if they are, that means that your partial solution counts; your more-than-zero counts. Your not-nothing counts.</p>
<p>And so you should never feel small because your contribution is small. Because it&#8217;s not about the distance, it&#8217;s about the difference.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s the <em>difference</em> between having some Japanese playing now and having none</strong>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the difference that counts. Small counts. A little counts. One counts. Half counts. Less than one counts. It&#8217;s only zero that doesn&#8217;t count. It&#8217;s only zero that can&#8217;t count.</p>
<p>You take care of the difference; time will erode the distance for you.<br />
Distance is a big girl. She&#8217;s a strong, independent woman. Don&#8217;t worry about her. She can take care of herself. Take care of the difference. It&#8217;s the difference that counts. It&#8217;s the difference that needs your attention.</p>
<p>This is what&#8217;s amazing about life: <strong>all your actions &#8212; and inactions &#8212; have consequences.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, that idea is used as a threat. And not in a playful way. It&#8217;s used as a very venomous, ominous threat.</p>
<div>But we can take the venom out, and when were do, we&#8217;re left with <strong>the astonishing and deeply fair fact that none of your actions are truly meaningless</strong>, because they all cause change in (excuse me for getting unnecessarily cosmic in scale) the Universe. Even one drop in the ocean causes a ripple <a class="simple-footnote" title="So why begrudge its not being an asteroid?" id="return-note-28476-1" href="#note-28476-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Everything you do makes a <em>difference</em>, even if its effect is over a small distance, every action, every twitch every blink, every breath in the video game of life gets you XP. Again, there is something curiously and <em>deeply</em> fair about that, a fundamental fairness, in a world where many things are &#8212; thankfully &#8212; unfair (unfair is good&#8230;without it, you couldn&#8217;t have machines and levers &#8212; literal and figurative &#8212; that help us get more out than we put in).</div>
<p>Breath is a good example. You don&#8217;t compare your breathing to other people&#8217;s (maybe if you&#8217;re in music you do, I dunno&#8230;and now that I&#8217;ve mentioned it, maybe you&#8217;re gonna start); you don&#8217;t feel jealous because &#8220;look at the lungs on that guy&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>More importantly, you don&#8217;t go skipping breaths because &#8220;this one doesn&#8217;t count&#8221;,</strong> or &#8220;I get so little air form each breath, what&#8217;s the point?&#8221;, or &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time for these stupid biological function right now; I&#8217;m busy; Ill breathe later&#8221;.</p>
<p>And you don&#8217;t sit back at the end of the day and look back at your breaths and go: &#8220;those were sheety breaths I took&#8230;gotta work on it&#8230;crap; I can&#8217;t take the pressure; I&#8217;m just gonna stop breathing until I learn how to do it right&#8221;.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t look at how much air you&#8217;re going to breathe this year, divide it by your lung capacity and despair at the size of the gap. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/there-is-no-end-what-are-you-going-to-do-about-it">No, because you&#8217;re subscribed to breath magazine. You&#8217;re not trying to &#8220;get it over with&#8221; and &#8220;get it out of the way&#8221; so you can go back to your &#8220;real&#8221; life. It&#8217;s not a punishment and it&#8217;s not vacation; it just is. </a>And it&#8217;s wonderful. It&#8217;s bloody marvelous.</p>
<p>When Japanese becomes like the air you breathe, Grasshopper, it&#8217;s just there. Like her hair, it&#8217;s everywhere. Screaming infidelities and clogging the sink. You just breathe it in, one little bit at time. You just live it. It&#8217;s just part of life. It&#8217;s just a part of you. We&#8217;re not really separate from the air, although we like to think we are. When we go into space or under water, we have to take it with us, otherwise the trip is short and harsh. It&#8217;s a part of us and we&#8217;re a part of it. <a class="simple-footnote" title="In fact, we need it more than it needs us." id="return-note-28476-2" href="#note-28476-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
<p>Japanese. Like the air you breathe. And you don&#8217;t have to breathe it in all at once. And it&#8217;s fine to exhale &#8212; to come into contact with things not Japanese &#8212; <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/critical-frequency-a-brand-new-way-of-looking-at-language-exposure">but you inhale again very soon; that&#8217;s the critical frequency idea.</a></p>
<p>Japanese. Like the air you breathe. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/beyond-binging-and-purging-why-you-maybe-shouldnt-try-overcorrecting-for-when-you-screw-up">You don&#8217;t binge breathe</a> <a class="simple-footnote" title="It&#8217;s called hyperventilating and it&#8217;s, uh, bad, mmm kay?" id="return-note-28476-3" href="#note-28476-3"><sup>3</sup></a>. You don&#8217;t quit breathing for six months then do cram-breathing for a week. You&#8217;d die. And so would your Japanese, metaphorically. And you&#8217;d be starting again more or less from scratch. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/boiling-water">That&#8217;s the boiling water idea.</a></p>
<p><strong>Breathe. Now. Not later. Not next week.</strong> Not when you&#8217;ve got everything set up and the new plant arrives. Now. Don&#8217;t try to inhale a fortnight&#8217;s worth of air in one breath (i.e. do a hundred or a thousand SRS reps in one sitting, or even be doing SRS reps for long enough that you would need to sit down to do them <a class="simple-footnote" title="Although&#8230;I did do I lot of reps in the restroom lately :)" id="return-note-28476-4" href="#note-28476-4"><sup>4</sup></a> &#8212; you want your reps to be in sprints and bursts). Breathe. Comfortably. Leisurely.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Caring about distance over difference is the classic mistake of people who are doing nothing</span> -</strong>-<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-have-you-been-killing-babies"> breath-holders and baby-killers who let their projects die. </a>Well-meaning people, I might add. Perfectionists and valedictorians and such-like. They care so much about distance they forget about difference.</p>
<p>A few paragraphs ago I made fun of cause snobs. Now I&#8217;m going to take a turn at eating the humble pie I so readily fed them.</p>
<p>People, including me, who make fun of charity and giving and acts of kindness &#8212; like the free Thanksgiving meals that Tony Robbins gives out every year &#8212; and say things like &#8220;it&#8217;s a band-aid&#8221;; &#8220;they&#8217;re not solving the systemic problem&#8221;; &#8220;what about the other 364 days of the year?&#8221;&#8230;because I have said and thought all those things.</p>
<p>Well, fark. Maybe it is imperfect. Maybe it is temporary. Maybe it is a small distance. And maybe some charitable organizations <a class="simple-footnote" title="Who says you have to work through an organization, though?" id="return-note-28476-5" href="#note-28476-5"><sup>5</sup></a> are unscrupulous or (worse) inefficient and waste contributions on administrative costs <a class="simple-footnote" title="American Red Cross and 9/11, anyone?" id="return-note-28476-6" href="#note-28476-6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Maybe they do use guilt and manipulation. Maybe it does almost all cancel out. But it&#8217;s a <em>difference</em>.</p>
<p>Plus, what have I done to help people? Nothing. I&#8217;m not a nice person.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bush+give+a+fuck+chris+rock"> If you were on a cliff and you needed one f-bomb, and I had a pocketful of them&#8230;I wouldn&#8217;t give you one</a>. If you were hungry, I would eat a bar of chocolate in front of you and not give you any. No, that&#8217;s a lie &#8212; I&#8217;d do worse: I would throw it away in front of you, so that <em>neither</em> of us could enjoy it! I&#8217;m twisted like that. I mean, I do what I can for the hookers and blow industries, but&#8230; <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>My zero people helped for zero days versus Tony Robbins&#8217; hundreds (thousands?) of families helped, for one day. For &#8220;only&#8221; one day. What other day is there, though? And what about the things you can&#8217;t measure, like hope and dignity?</p>
<p>I mean, dang. It&#8217;s not enough that he helps people &#8212; doing things he has no obligation to do whatsoever &#8212; he has to do a perfect job of it, too? And his solution has to work forever? And he isn&#8217;t allowed to benefit from it in terms of good publicity and warm fuzzies and stuff? Come on, now&#8230;who&#8217;s really full of crap now? That&#8217;s a clusterhump of crappy rules made up by people who aren&#8217;t doing anything at all to help. People like me.</p>
<p>The distance between nothing and something is small, but the difference is infinite. One may be close to zero, but it&#8217;s nothing like zero.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s enough that you&#8217;re doing any Japanese at all.</strong> You&#8217;re making a difference. Don&#8217;t make things complicated by trying to do a good job of it as well. That&#8217;s the irony of the process. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/japanese-is-useless-and-a-waste-of-time-stop-learning-it">The more important it is to you, the <em>less</em> you need to care, the <em>less</em> important you need to make each move</a>. Because there are going to be tens of thousands of moves; you can&#8217;t get hung up on one or two &#8212; like breaths and MCD reps, by the time you&#8217;re done with one, you&#8217;re already working on the next one. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/vocabulary-expansion-circle-of-concern-circle-of-control">If you would be in control, be unconcerned.</a></p>

Are you planning on travelling to a country where they speak tooth?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me hit you with some knowledge, sister.</p>
<p>There is no end. To learning. A language.</p>
<p>And I know that sounds super lame. It&#8217;s not what you want to hear; it&#8217;s not what I wanted to hear. Especially when you&#8217;re young. You want results. You want achievements. You want to be doing awesome things. You want&#8230;things that <em>end</em> and are <em>bounded</em> and that do so on time scales you can fathom and stomach <a class="simple-footnote" title="Incidentally, this is what timeboxing basically does for you &#8220;artificially&#8221;. It makes things doable because we go out there and set an upper bound." id="return-note-28365-1" href="#note-28365-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. You want <em>doability</em>. Neverending isn&#8217;t doable. It just sounds like punishment.</p>
<p>But wait. There&#8217;s hope.</p>
<p>There is no end.</p>
<p>To learning a language.</p>
<p><strong>But there is an end to sucking.</strong></p>
<p>On that you can rely. Of that you can rest assured. There is an end to sucking.</p>
<p>At that end to sucking can be brought about at blinding &#8212; or relatively blinding &#8212; speed. Sucking can and will end.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a catch (oh no)!</p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p>A big, fat, screw-you, silly-fairy-tale-TV-trope-narrative-device-like catch.</p>
<p>Maintenance.</p>
<p>Suck is like dust but worse. Like beach sand. But worse. You&#8217;re always on suck removal detail. Permanently. And the moment you&#8217;re not, it starts to take over. <a class="simple-footnote" title="It&#8217;s a war of attrition with suck and you win by frequent exposure. I say &#8220;win&#8221;, really, you stay ahead. There is no final victory, only the continual victory of exposure, the maintenance of the upper hand." id="return-note-28365-2" href="#note-28365-2"><sup>2</sup></a> And unlike housework and real dust, you can&#8217;t outsource it. You can get help (e.g. an SRS) &#8212; use labor-saving devices &#8212; but you&#8217;re still there, removing suck.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all very well learning a language. Everybody can. Everybody does. Don&#8217;t come up to me with weird exceptions. Some people are born without limbs, it doesn&#8217;t stop us describing human beings as having legs, and it doesn&#8217;t make the people who don&#8217;t share that quality any less human&#8230;.why &#8212; is this high school? Why am I even getting worked up about this? You know what? It&#8217;s my fault for even&#8230;</p>
<p>ANYWAY!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all very well learning a language. But the catch that there&#8217;s nothing to catch.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a process, not an event.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a book purchase.<br />
It&#8217;s a magazine subscription.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a skill.<br />
It&#8217;s a habit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a bullet point on resume.<br />
It&#8217;s a way of life.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a trophy animal.<br />
It&#8217;s a pet. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Which reminds me&#8230;
You see a lot of people choose pets on looks.
Dumb move.
It&#8217;s got to be about the personality. The temperament. About how you and he get along. He&#8217;s got to be a Good Guy Greg, not just a pretty face." id="return-note-28365-3" href="#note-28365-3"><sup>3</sup></a>
<p>You don&#8217;t possess it. You don&#8217;t hold it.<br />
You live it. You are it.</p>
<p><strong>Live it or lose it.</strong> Now. Here. Today. And every day. This is the bitter truth. Your polyglot heroes? They&#8217;re good; they&#8217;re demn good; but even they lose the ones they don&#8217;t live. And that&#8217;s fine (I guess&#8230;yeah&#8230;it&#8217;s fine <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  ), especially if they had fun in the process, but most people <em>don&#8217;t </em>have fun in the process. In fact, they find fun <em>suspect</em>! They have a no-pain, no-gain, delayed gratification approach to the whole thing. They have a grim, masochistic, &#8220;mountaineering&#8221; approach to learning.<em></em></p>
<p>And that effen sucks because <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/there-is-only-instant-gratification">there is no gratification to delay.</a> There is no pot of gold on the other side of the fluency rainbow, there is just you. The only gold you will find there will be the gold you brought along &#8212; the gold of having had so much fun in the process.</p>
<p>A language is not a mountain (I&#8217;ve used mountain metaphors before and I&#8217;m sorry; I was wrong). You don&#8217;t scale it. You don&#8217;t climb it and you&#8217;re done. It&#8217;s not a conquest. It&#8217;s not a thing. It&#8217;s not static, it&#8217;s dynamic. It&#8217;s not stock, it&#8217;s flow. It&#8217;s a river. I mean, it&#8217;s not really a river, but it&#8217;s much more like a river, or rowing up one, than it is like a mountain. It is moving. And so are you. Either upstream or downstream.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like bathing or brushing your teeth. Once is never enough. It has to happen and it has to keep happening.<strong> There is no &#8220;end-game&#8221; to brushing your teeth.</strong> Bathing isn&#8217;t a phase you&#8217;re going through. Brushing your teeth isn&#8217;t a goal, it&#8217;s a habit, a system, a way of life, an integral part of life.</p>
<p>Quick! What&#8217;s your end game with brushing your teeth? Where are you hoping to go with that? What are you hoping to do with it? What kind of jobs (ugh) can you get with yer clean-a$$ teeth? What&#8217;s the plan? Are you going to be a TV anchor? Huh? Are you planning on travelling to a country where they speak tooth?</p>
<p>Animal reproduction you. Seriously? The corporate human resources/high school guidance counselor route?</p>
<p>Can you see how stupid and short-sighted these utilitarian questions are? Yet we ask these things about languages the whole time. Language value, the value of language proficiency, assuming constant improvement,<strong> ages like fine wine, not milk</strong>. The deeper and longer you go, the better it gets and the better you get. Languages don&#8217;t go out of style. They got out of &#8220;style&#8221;, but they don&#8217;t stop being awesome and useful and relevant &#8212; even &#8220;dead&#8221; languages. Languages are tenacious like that; they hold onto their value. And the socio-economic rewards, if we might return to utility, are, ironically, disproportionately weighted on the right-hand-side, the aristocratic, &#8220;long-term&#8221;, lifestyle side, not on the wham-bam-thank-you-Ma&#8217;am side. A language is the one thing you could learn now that would still be valuable and relevant to you in its original form 50 years from now; there are not many things like that.</p>
<p>Does short-term language acquisition have value? Of course it does <a class="simple-footnote" title="For one thing, it can be good, clean fun &#8212; if you let it be. But most people don&#8217;t, won&#8217;t, can&#8217;t do that &#8212; they don&#8217;t even know how any more!" id="return-note-28365-4" href="#note-28365-4"><sup>4</sup></a>. When I went to Korea back in 2008, not knowing a single word of Korean, or a single hangul character&#8230;I wanted to know a little bit of Korean; any amount would have helped. I couldn&#8217;t get street directions; I literally didn&#8217;t even know how to say &#8220;thank you&#8221;. So no one&#8217;s saying <a href="http://is.gd/nQymve">short-term, quick-and-dirty language acquisition</a> doesn&#8217;t have value &#8212; in fact, techniquewise, deep acquisition looks and works <em>virtually the exact same</em> as shallow&#8230;all you do is extend it, like adding segments to a Lincoln to make a stretch limo.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/intermediate-goals-mini-dreams">it&#8217;s fine to have a goal or two in there</a>, games to play with yourself, if you like that sort of thing, but it&#8217;s crucial to have a lifestyle &#8212; a <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-system-will-set-you-free">system</a>. Like the man said: <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/230333">&#8220;goals are good for planning your progress&#8230;systems are good for actually <em>making</em> progress.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>The delicious irony is that if you take a long-term, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/let-go-but-dont-let-go-the-learning-paradox">intensely laid-back</a> <a class="simple-footnote" title="A sort of Talebian barbell strategy." id="return-note-28365-5" href="#note-28365-5"><sup>5</sup></a> view, you get all the utilitarian gains you want. If you just chill and stop trying to choke that goose, it&#8217;ll lay you all the golden eggs you want. And more. You will not get what you deserve; you will not get as much as you put in; you will get more &#8212; you will get more than you deserve. So if you&#8217;re seeking the real value, the deep value, the value is in staying and having fun, not in following trends, not in competition and intellectual jockery with other jerks you don&#8217;t even like. You don&#8217;t need to collect languages like notches on a bedpost. You don&#8217;t need to know them all. You don&#8217;t need to know them now. You&#8217;re better off knowing them well &#8212; including your L1; <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/search?num=100&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=fs1&amp;rls=org.mozilla:ja:official&amp;hl=ja&amp;channel=fflb&amp;q=vocabulary+johnson+o%27connor&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KNTqUu2QFsrukQXGg4Bw&amp;ved=0CCUQvwUoAA&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=527">adding depth to your L1 will, believe it or not, change your life.</a></p>
<p>But&#8230;but&#8230;Khatz&#8230;are you basically saying&#8230;don&#8217;t learn languages?</p>
<p>Yeah. No. Kinda. Definitely insofar as you define learning as a painful process separate from life, opposed to life and not itself a part of life. I&#8217;m saying&#8230;<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/gloaf-give-less-of-a-fucare">GLOAF</a>. Because if you take off that pressure for instant results and in fact for results at all, you will think and breathe and live clearly, and, ironically, you may also get some fast results, but that won&#8217;t be the point. But this isn&#8217;t something you can game &#8212; at least I don&#8217;t think it is &#8212; you can&#8217;t pretend to be laid-back but secretly be panicking, you actually have to stop effing panicking and that&#8217;s&#8230;there&#8217;s some emotional honesty there that I can&#8217;t help you with. I&#8217;m just&#8230;tired of these people who need &#8212; NEED &#8212; to know three languages at an academic AND fully conversational level <em>yesterday</em> because girlfriend is Japanese and engineering degree in China OR ELSE the world WILL end.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not how knowledge works and that&#8217;s not the knowledge you need. You don&#8217;t need to turn yourself into a little force-fed, hormoned-up battery farm chicken. There are much more elegant ways of living and getting what you want and they don&#8217;t involve pain, suffering or impressing easily impressed strangers.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m saying: stop the panic. Stop the fear. Stop the sense of obligation. These aren&#8217;t serving you; they&#8217;re oppressing you and they are literally, neurologically, making you stupid, because that&#8217;s what fear (or panic or stress or whatever you find fashionable to call it) does.</p>
<p>This is what&#8217;s hard to believe; it&#8217;s hard for me to even say it because it sounds like an irresponsible lie: when you stop having utilitarian concerns about your language(s), the utility takes care of itself. So you don&#8217;t need to do miserly things like <em>only</em> learning high-frequency words because they&#8217;re the only &#8220;useful&#8221; ones&#8230;which is not to say that word frequency can&#8217;t have a place as a strategic game, it&#8217;s just&#8230;<strong>this game isn&#8217;t shallow like that.</strong> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Another paradox: high frequency words are most immediately useful, but a well-placed low frequency word &#8212; or knowledge of it &#8212; moves hearts and minds most readily, which, if you deal with humans, is a useful thing&#8230;moving hearts and minds, that is. Anyway, you can&#8217;t just reduce the value of words to their frequency; that kind of reductionism is incredibly naïve, bureaucratic and almost Orwellian." id="return-note-28365-6" href="#note-28365-6"><sup>6</sup></a> You don&#8217;t need to do any of that driving-across-town-to-save-25-cents-on-milk silliness to get more &#8220;bang for your buck&#8221;.</p>
<p>Anyway, so, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s really deep and interesting about learning &#8212; getting used to &#8212; languages: <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/before-fluency-after-fluency">the process and lifestyle of &#8220;getting there&#8221; is </a><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/before-fluency-after-fluency">fundamentally </a><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/before-fluency-after-fluency"><em>the same</em></a><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/before-fluency-after-fluency"> as the process and lifestyle once you&#8217;re &#8220;there&#8221; &#8212; assuming, that is, that you want to stay there, in Idontsuckistan<em>.</em></a></p>
<p>Like brushing your teeth, it doesn&#8217;t fundamentally change, only superficially. A bit of tech here and there. You switch brushes. But you&#8217;re still brushing.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Learning&#8221; a language &#8212; in a fun, successful way, at least &#8212; looks and works and basically is virtually the exact same as maintaining it.</strong> And it never ends. If you think about it, native speakers have all made this peace. They&#8217;re not going anywhere. They&#8217;re not in this for show. They&#8217;re not here to get a trophy and then &#8220;move on&#8221; to &#8220;other challenges&#8221;. They&#8217;re not passing through. They&#8217;re in this one forever. And they play every day. They wake up playin&#8217;; they play all day and then they go to sleep and play some more in their dreams. And they&#8217;re cool with that because they&#8217;re having fun; they&#8217;re not showing off; <strong>they&#8217;ve got no point to prove</strong>; they&#8217;re just <em>living</em>.</p>
<p>Do likewise.</p>
<p>Even polyglots and hyperglots have that one language (or languages) that they never leave. And this is the language they are truly &#8220;learning&#8221;. <strong>The language you&#8217;re living is the language you&#8217;re</strong> <strong>learning, not the language(s) you&#8217;re &#8220;learning&#8221;</strong>: those are just painful motions you&#8217;re going through &#8212; motions that you&#8217;ll soon forget. The language that you thoughtlessly, effortlessly, relentlessly have around you is the language you&#8217;re &#8220;learning&#8221;; it&#8217;s the language of your pillow, your car, your toilet, your web browser history, your smartphone&#8230;not of your study desk or your precious &#8220;projects list&#8221;.<strong></strong></p>
<p>There is no end game <a class="simple-footnote" title="There&#8217;s death and that&#8217;s about it." id="return-note-28365-7" href="#note-28365-7"><sup>7</sup></a>.

And if you&#8217;re not enjoying yourself now, there&#8217;s nothing on the other side for you. I&#8217;m not kidding. There&#8217;s no&#8230;understanding more things and getting more jokes isn&#8217;t going to make you happy; it&#8217;s just going to make you&#8230;better informed. Think about it: what do human beings even talk about anyway? The <em>exact same effen crap</em> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Gossip, complaints, fear, loathing, love, directions, and &#8212; if you pick well &#8212; deep ideas" id="return-note-28365-9" href="#note-28365-9"><sup>9</sup></a>; in every language. <a class="simple-footnote" title="You could guess and you would probably be right or not too far off." id="return-note-28365-10" href="#note-28365-10"><sup>10</sup></a> They&#8217;re not hiding the secret to life in your L2.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8220;Quick and dirty wins the race.<br />
Perfection is the enemy of done.<br />
Good enough is really effin&#8217; good.&#8221;<br />
Andrea Scher</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When you first start off trying to solve a problem, the first solutions you come up with are very complex, and most people stop there. But if you keep going, and live with the problem and peel more layers of the onion off, you can often times arrive at some very elegant and simple solutions. Most people just don’t put in the time&#8230;to get there.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B9%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%96%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A7%E3%83%96%E3%82%BA">The Syrian</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s the trick to making deep, long-term, self-directed language-learning work.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t do ten good things.</p>
<p>Do <em>one</em> good thing. One day. At a time.</p>
<p>And not even a very good thing. Just a good enough thing. Just barely good enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hunter who chases two rabbits catches neither&#8221;. Well, think about the hunter who chases ten. Fast ones. That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re doing when you try to do good things. All he ends up is tired, self-loathing and with a stitch. <a class="simple-footnote" title="If he were smart about it, he&#8217;d set rabbit traps, but this post isn&#8217;t about cruel ways of making animals die, so&#8230;we&#8217;ll leave the metaphor at that :P" id="return-note-28303-1" href="#note-28303-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
<p>What you want to do is <strong>catch slow rabbits</strong>. Spice them well if you have to.</p>
<p>But you&#8217;re like: &#8220;But I should be catching fast ones!&#8221;<br />
Why? Speed is relative anyway. Look, you&#8217;re not catching<em> an</em><em>y</em> ones at the rate you&#8217;re going. You&#8217;re Elmer Fudd and you&#8217;ve got <em>one-itis</em> for Bugs Bunny, and that&#8217;s really bad because Bugs is too darn quick. And now you&#8217;re rabbitless.</p>
<p>Catch slow rabbits.</p>
<p>It all comes down to ideas. A lot of people have ideas. Good ideas. All the time. <strong>The problem is we usually don&#8217;t let our idea-generation machines &#8212; our brains &#8212; run their course.</strong> We usually latch onto the first idea that pops up (&#8220;take a Japanese class!&#8221;) and cling onto it for dear life, come heck or high water. And then we call that &#8220;persistence&#8221;, and when it inevitably turns out to be an unsustainable idea, we hate ourselves and say we lack genetic talent.</p>
<p>So, one way of getting to your third-rate idea is to skip through your first few ideas.</p>
<p>The thing is that most people&#8217;s first idea is that it&#8217;s really difficult. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s a good idea; it&#8217;s a respectable idea; it&#8217;s a first-rate idea;<strong> it&#8217;s a good idea</strong> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Yeah, I said it twice" id="return-note-28303-2" href="#note-28303-2"><sup>2</sup></a><strong>. And that&#8217;s precisely why it&#8217;s so bad. You&#8217;re not fast enough for that rabbit.</strong> Type out your MCDs by hand? That&#8217;s a first-rate idea. You&#8217;re a good person for thinking that. You are the teacher&#8217;s pet. We love you. You&#8217;re the girl the who writes and posts hand-written thank-you notes to everyone she meets within 20 minutes of saying goodbye. You win.</p>
<p>But you lose because <strong>that crap is unsustainable. </strong></p>
<p>Go further down the list. Go down until you get to <strong>something you feel guilty about doing because it&#8217;s too easy</strong>. It&#8217;s third-rate; it&#8217;s lazy; it&#8217;s everything that&#8217;s wrong with the world today and the &#8220;the present generation&#8221;. <a class="simple-footnote" title="It&#8217;s sending your Mum a birthday text instead of a handwritten card &#8212; oh no, you don&#8217;t love your mother any more because you communicate with her using new and easier media; kill yourself now! It&#8217;s using a calculator to do arithmetic." id="return-note-28303-3" href="#note-28303-3"><sup>3</sup></a> It&#8217;s using digital dictionaries and pre-typed, pre-translated text. It&#8217;s looping the same few dozen podcasts because you like them and nothing else is that interesting and you can&#8217;t be bothered to go find anything else right now.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t go with the best idea. <strong>Don&#8217;t go with the first idea.</strong> Get lazier. Go deeper down the idea chain. Easier. Lazier. Simpler. Less equipment. Less gear. Less effort. Less energy. Less stuff. Fewer people. Fewer resources. Go with that weird, easy one that doesn&#8217;t seem like it shouldn&#8217;t work or count because it&#8217;s too weird and too easy and too simple.</p>
<p>When you think about it, the entire AJATT &#8220;method&#8221; itself is one big third-rate idea. Because the first-rate thing to do would be to move to Japan and live with a Japanese family, eating, sleeping and drinking Japanese until nature worked its magic. It would be learning Spanish by living on a vineyard in the countryside with nothing but&#8230;Spanish. But you may or may not have that option open for two years. One the other hand, you certainly have an iPod, a smartphone, a something; you certainly have headphones. Eeeenh?</p>
<p>To get terribly domestic again for a moment, the first-rate thing to do would be to wash your dishes. That would be the best thing. Wash, dry and store. But that rabbit&#8217;s too fast. All those rabbits are too fast. The third-rate thing is to get your dishes to the sink. Just get them there.</p>
<p>It would take two lifetimes and more amphetamines than anyone could safely consume, to accomplish your first-rate ideas. That&#8217;s how energy-intensive they are. You can&#8217;t do them. So don&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t even try. Go down till you get to something easy. Ideas are free, so you might as well use the ones that pay you back.</p>
<p>You cannot carry out your first-rate ideas. In all likelihood, not even a robot could (which says something about the state of both your ideas and robotics). And even if you could carry them out, you couldn&#8217;t sustain them. You would burn out to a perfect little crisp like you have so many times before. Your sense of righteousness is writing cheques that your physical energy cannot and will not cash <a class="simple-footnote" title="Who even uses cheques?! No, but seriously, you won&#8217;t waste money and you&#8217;ll try not to waste time, but you&#8217;ll waste energy? Really?" id="return-note-28303-4" href="#note-28303-4"><sup>4</sup></a>. How do I know? I know because I&#8217;ve personally been you; I&#8217;ve seen you and I&#8217;ve lived with people like you. If you could carry out your ideas, you&#8217;d be carrying them out; you wouldn&#8217;t be talking about them; you wouldn&#8217;t be worrying about them; you wouldn&#8217;t even be thinking about them &#8212; you&#8217;d be carrying them out because that&#8217;s how easy and effortless they&#8217;d be.</p>
<p>And the only things that are that easy and that effortless are third-rate ideas. Third-string ideas. Third-stringers. The ones that come after the &#8220;good&#8221; ones. The ones that come after the teacher&#8217;s-pet &#8220;correct&#8221; answer from the textbook. The ones that are <strong>so easy to do that you still feel bad afterwards &#8212; because they leave you feeling light and free and guilty when you&#8217;re so used to feeling heavy and tired <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  .</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.gretchenrubin.com/happiness_project/2009/01/your-happiness-project-dont-let-the-perfect-be-the-enemy-of-the-good/">It&#8217;s the power of the suboptimal.</a></p>
<p>By way of ending on a concrete note, here are a few examples of first-rate ideas you need to stop having:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typing out SRS cards by hand
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s all about the copy and paste, mate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Perfectly/uniformly formatting SRS cards
<ul>
<li>I hear there are some deck chairs on the <em>Titanic</em> that still need straightening&#8230;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finishing things you start because you started them
<ul>
<li>Are you a lemming? Do you have to go over the cliff because that&#8217;s the direction you were going in? Let&#8217;s leave aside whether real-life lemmings actually do that or not; I&#8217;m talking about the Game Gear game ones <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learning things to prove things to other people
<ul>
<li>Why? Let them live in doubt! Why do you have to change the beliefs of people who don&#8217;t want their beliefs changed? Are you so <em>anxious</em> that pigs should wear the fine jewelry you&#8217;ve got on offer? Would not good-looking women who are into jewelry suffice? What is so good about your truth that the <em>whole world</em> must know and understand today or else?</li>
<li>Even cults pick their marks. The smart ones go for the slow rabbits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intentionally studying for more than 2 minutes at a time
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s all about the short sprints, mate</li>
<li>It&#8217;s fine if it naturally extends out, but geez, don&#8217;t force it&#8230;don&#8217;t plan on it. Concentration is a limited resource like that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Doing superlatives (best, fastest, most effective, most efficient)
<ul>
<li>Ease in. Shave rather than cut. Cryptic, I know.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
