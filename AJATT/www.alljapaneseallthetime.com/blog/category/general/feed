				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I&#8217;ve been reading about politics and history lately. <a href="http://is.gd/YOvLOm"><em>Voltaire&#8217;s Bastards</em></a>, <a href="http://is.gd/u4ijQw">Amaury de Riencourt</a>, <a href="http://is.gd/bCl6ZN">David Deutsch (<em>The Beginning of Infinity</em>)</a>, stuff like that.</p>
<p>And I came upon something of a&#8230;how can I put this&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fashionable &#8212; and even justifiable &#8212; to roundly dismiss many of the heroes and products of the English-speaking world. Stop riding Newton&#8217;s nuts, Leibniz was just as good if not better &#8212; better calculus notation and a kanji lover. Stop cupping Darwin&#8217;s eye&#8230;balls, he was just kind of OK; he had a theory but no mechanism to explain it in his time. You know, the usual.</p>
<p>Frankly, it&#8217;s one of my favorite pastimes, and I engage in it on a regular basis.</p>
<p>But there are many pieces of Anglophone &#8212; and specifically British &#8212; triumphalism that are actually triumphs; one in particular rarely gets the exposure and credit it deserves <a class="simple-footnote" title="Hint: The answer is not any of the world wars; these were pan-European civil wars whose sole victor, no matter what the textbooks and treaties tell you, was the United States. Without her involvement, they would probably still be fighting in Europe right now. The US literally prevented Europe from &#8220;eating itself&#8221;. Twice. And no one ever said &#8220;thank you&#8221;." id="return-note-30178-1" href="#note-30178-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. And that is the weird, heterogeneous institution that is modern constitutional monarchy and how it evolved.</p>
<p>Um&#8230;like, I don&#8217;t know enough about the topic to actually discuss it intelligently; I don&#8217;t have the vocabulary or background knowledge. <strong>So, I&#8217;ll just tell you how this applies to learning Japanese.</strong> <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/dont-start-clean-start-dirty-why-a-clean-slate-is-bad-for-you-and-what-to-do-about-it">It&#8217;s basically the whole &#8220;starting dirty&#8221; idea</a>, just expressed using political and economic metaphors <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-make-big-srs-changes-the-darwinian-game">rather than biological ones.</a></p>
<p>Good <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A2%E5%AD%A6%E6%B4%BE">economists</a> like Hayek and <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9F%E3%83%AB%E3%83%88%E3%83%B3%E3%83%BB%E3%83%95%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3">Friedman</a> would probably explain it like this: there is implicit knowledge and wisdom embedded and distributed in the market that no central plan or central planner is capable of articulating let alone equaling in quality, precision, quantity and effectiveness.</p>
<p>This same insight was reflected in British culture and politics: there is knowledge and wisdom embedded and distributed in <em>tradition</em> that no overarching manifesto, no theory, no single political ideology is capable of articulating let alone equaling in effectiveness.</p>
<p>Was this insight always right? No. British culture tends to respect tradition to the point of fetishistic worship. But it put the brakes on nice-sounding theories like the French Revolution, Communism (the Russian Revolution) and even the American Revolution, which, for all its big talk, has not truly delivered on the goods; America isn&#8217;t nearly as free a country as it likes to think it is, existing in glaring contradiction with its own loudly proclaimed founding standards. Like Subway marketing itself as health food, America is the best freedom brand of all time &#8211; it has all the cool commercials &#8211; but far greater freedom and far healthier food remain, ironically enough, <em>unadvertised, </em>unmarketed and available <em>outside</em> the Estados Unidos and Subway.</p>
<p>The British constitution is unwritten. You can&#8217;t find it anywhere, any more than you can &#8220;find&#8221; your blood &#8212; it&#8217;s all over the place. There&#8217;s the Magna Carta and a Bill of Rights of some kind somewhere, but, as I understand it, it&#8217;s mostly just implicit &#8212; precedent and all that. Or so I&#8217;m told, I dunno.</p>
<p>Taken at face value, this kind of brazen vagueness seems like a rather delicious recipe for disaster by corrosive, incremental tyranny. Interestingly enough, though, many of the <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%A1%E3%83%AA%E3%82%AB%E5%90%88%E8%A1%86%E5%9B%BD%E5%BB%BA%E5%9B%BD%E3%81%AE%E7%88%B6">18th century English colonists on the American continent who seceded from the mother country</a> thought that individual rights were more or less unlimited and should thus remain unwritten so they could stay unlimited. This anti-codification opinion lost out and the USA grew into a famously legalistic, <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B3%95%E5%85%B8%E5%8C%96">codificious</a> culture &#8212; witness the proliferation of <a href="http://is.gd/VnPlEu">&#8220;mission statements&#8221; in American business training and personal development</a>; in American religion, you see it in <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%E3%83%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%A2%E3%83%B3+%E9%BB%92%E4%BA%BA">the Mormon insistence on making up explanations for things that could have safely remained unexplained and thus prevented a whole lot of bad PR</a>.</p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re here, this isn&#8217;t a put-down of all things American. The truth is that America, like Rodney Dangerfield, gets no respect &#8211; not even from Americans. And when it does get respect, it gets them for the wrong reasons (<a href="http://is.gd/H81Bvv">freedom</a> it <a href="http://is.gd/LMySGN">doesn&#8217;t have</a>, <a href="http://is.gd/wwcsZg">interethnic harmony that only exists on television</a>, and a nationhood <a href="http://is.gd/wwcsZg">built on a foundation of, what&#8217;s the word I&#8217;m looking for&#8230;oh yeah &#8212; genocide</a> <a class="simple-footnote" title="You could say the same thing about Australia as well, and that&#8217;s also a constitutional monarchy/&#8221;crowned republic&#8221;, so&#8230;this whole silly article becomes moot." id="return-note-30178-2" href="#note-30178-2"><sup>2</sup></a>). American marketing techniques and personal development literature are, by far, the best in the world. Yet, as it happens, they tend to be mocked or &#8212; more often and perhaps worse &#8212; simply ignored, to the great detriment of the ignorers and mockers. William James and Ralph Waldo Emerson were the dog&#8217;s bollocks, but <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AA%E3%82%B9%E3%83%B4%E3%82%A1%E3%83%AB%E3%83%88%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%9A%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%BC">brooding, emo</a>, <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BB%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E3%83%BB%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%83%B3%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B4%E3%83%83%E3%83%9B">Old World &#8220;artists&#8221;</a> seem to get all the glory.</p>
<p>Mindsetwise, American optimism continues to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, because the belief that things can be changed for the better makes people take the actions necessary to make that belief come true. Many countries have more entrepreneur-friendly laws, better infrastructure, gorgeous weather and a better-educated populace, but Silicon Valley is still in California, in no small part because that&#8217;s where you&#8217;re allowed to believe in ridiculous things and act out those beliefs during the day, while sober, using real tools and money. And here&#8217;s where it get&#8217;s crazier: if you mess up, it&#8217;s a good thing and you just try again!</p>
<p>This optimism, combined with an almost talismanic reverence for America&#8217;s founding documents produces a steady stream of John Browns, Ralph Naders, Martin Luther Kings, Larry Flynts and countless other entrepreneurs and true believers, ready and eager to bring the documents to life. So there&#8217;s that.</p>
<p>As for marketing, whatever their artistic shortcomings, Hollywood movies are the best <em>sold</em> in the world, a great deal of thought and skill goes into making them make money and the lack of cognizance of and respect for this fact only underscores the intellectual laziness of intellectual snobs &#8211; it&#8217;s childish (not child-like, which would be good, just bratty) to expect a movie to sell well simply because it &#8220;deserves&#8221; to.</p>
<p>By that logic, my mother&#8217;s orange peel chocolate cookies should be the most popular food in the world, but they&#8217;re not, McDonald&#8217;s (OK, rice, but, whatever) is. And, crap product notwithstanding, McDonald&#8217;s marketing, distribution and quality control systems are massive achievements of human thought <a class="simple-footnote" title="And animal cruelty so&#8230;yeah&#8230;awkward." id="return-note-30178-3" href="#note-30178-3"><sup>3</sup></a>, deserving of measured respect and admiration. <em>You</em> try to make billions of servings of food always taste the same and not (instantly) kill people.</p>
<p>Plus, be honest. Do you <em>really</em> want to see <a href="http://is.gd/T3Py8u">some sad, artsy French film</a> with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103616/">no plot and no closure</a>? Really, bro? Really?</p>
<p>Where we? Oh yeah. Learning, sorry, getting used to, Japanese.</p>
<p>The thing about Marxism, the Communist Manifesto, the French Revolution, all these things, is that they seemed so <em>reasonable</em>. So logical. So cogent. So well-structured. So linear. So obvious. So architectonically beautiful. Edifices of the mind. Had I been alive in the right place and time, I would have fallen for and gotten behind every single one of these ideas. <a class="simple-footnote" title="No contest. &#8220;Liberty, equality, fraternity&#8221; versus&#8230;despotic, blingy, in-bred monarch? Are you kidding me?" id="return-note-30178-4" href="#note-30178-4"><sup>4</sup></a>
<p>But they were all wrong. Very badly wrong. Why? Because <strong>for all their superficial complexity, they were actually rather <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B5%8C%E6%B8%88%E4%BA%BA">crude and blunt and simplistic</a>.</strong> They were all straight lines and rectangles: no circles, no curves, and definitely no fractals. No fuzzy bits. No warmth, no character, no squishiness, no personality. No <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-african-way-of-learning-just-do-it">soul</a>. Sort of like replacing all the plants in the world with well-drawn pictures of plants. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Ironically, of course, Marx was a big fan of Darwin; he saw Communism as a societal evolutionary theory and even wanted to dedicate Das Kapital to Charles, but Darwin was like: &#8220;I just wanna be friends, mayn&#8221;." id="return-note-30178-5" href="#note-30178-5"><sup>5</sup></a>
<p>To put it unoriginally: <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/bucolic-wisdom-or-stop-slagging-seeds-silly-city-slickers">life is&#8230;organic. It&#8217;s crooked, cyclical, elliptical. It doesn&#8217;t like your neat little boxes and categories. It sprouts weeds through your perfectly paved concrete. It doesn&#8217;t make Euclidean shapes</a>. It&#8217;s <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AB%E3%82%AA%E3%82%B9%E7%90%86%E8%AB%96">chaotic, in the Lorenzian sense</a>. It refuses to be tamed, to submit to your dictatorial, <a href="http://is.gd/NSASQd">&#8220;top-down, Soviet-Harvard&#8221; rationalism</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Your Japanese learning methods, to work well, need to reflect life&#8217;s organic nature</strong>. The temptation is and always will be to make violent changes &#8212; not bold changes (those are good), violent ones &#8212; to perfectly format your SRS cards, to make everything look and act the same, to make one size fit all, to use schedules and neat little boxes and straight lines, to not even consider trying any idea that hasn&#8217;t appeared in at least three peer-reviewed journals (&#8220;no respected scientist says that listening while you sleep helps, therefore it cannot help, unless and until she says so!&#8221;) &#8212; the same journals that said the exact opposite thing last year.</p>
<p><strong>The temptation will be to respect authority over experimentation</strong>, to denigrate all empiricism &#8212; especially any arising from your own experience &#8211; to do away with your personal traditions (i.e. habits and preferences), to <strong>burn it all down and built it back up from scratch </strong>instead of renovating, extending or just <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/?q=%E6%96%AD%E6%8D%A8%E9%9B%A2++++++++&amp;num=100#num=100&amp;q=%E6%96%AD%E6%8D%A8%E9%9B%A2++++++++">removing furniture</a>. To try revolution before evolution, to be imperious instead of incremental. To <strong>write up decrees and manifestos instead of just tinkering and trying stuff out.</strong></p>
<p>And what&#8217;ll happen? <a href="http://is.gd/u4ijQw">You&#8217;ll be a &#8220;republic&#8221;</a> with your constitution and your rules and your <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9D%E3%83%81%E3%83%A7%E3%83%A0%E3%82%AD%E3%83%B3%E6%9D%91">perfect-on-paper methods and systems</a>&#8230;for about five minutes; you&#8217;ll be a zealot, a monk of your new, perfect religion&#8230;for about three days before devolving into suffering and despotism and forcing yourself to do ridiculously boring things like slogging through some premade Anki deck made from some textbook.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/flame-less-journal-more-win">You&#8217;ll write down what you believe and get into endless, bitter arguments about the minutiae of what you believe, your precious little articles of faith &#8212; as if your opinion mattered &#8212; instead of just living it</a>. Like arguing about what to eat instead of just eating it. Or when chicks spend more time discussing, dissecting and defining their romantic relationships than, well, actually experiencing them and actually <em>relating</em> to the person they&#8217;re supposedly &#8220;with&#8221; (see my new book: <em>Baseless Remarks About Complex Social Phenomena</em> <em>III</em>, for more details).</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll do all that&#8230;</p>
<p>When you coulda just had fun and figured stuff out as you went along and added some parts and removed others. And <strong>yeah, you end up with a &#8220;hodge-podge&#8221; of ideas and tools and methods that doesn&#8217;t look smooth and pretty and is hard to even articulate, but it&#8217;s <em>your</em> hodge-podge, man, and it works for <em>you</em></strong> (WhoTF else matters?!) and it&#8217;s good and you&#8217;re happy and isn&#8217;t that all that really effing matters?</p>
<p>Hard to articulate. But easy to live and do.</p>
<p>The funny thing about constitutional monarchy is that it wasn&#8217;t planned out from the beginning, if at all. It&#8217;s <strong>the result of a lot of winging it</strong>, a lot of fighting and arguing and pressuring and complaining and compromising <a class="simple-footnote" title="Even now, some people see it as merely an unfinished republican revolution &#8212; vestigial despotism &#8212; instead of the accidentally clever and sophisticated separation-of-powers that it is (Spain actually re-instituted CM after shedding its fascist dictatorship&#8230;then again, Italy had a fascist dictatorship with CM, so&#8230;you&#8217;re literally witnessing everything I just said contradicting itself). Just to confuse things even further, Switzerland&#8217;s a republic and it runs like clockwork." id="return-note-30178-6" href="#note-30178-6"><sup>6</sup></a>. In many ways, its development was motivated and accelerated as much <em>by</em> other systems as in spite of them &#8212; royal heads in Europe were rolling with somewhat alarming frequency, and not for the usual royal reasons, either; colonies were seceding. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War">And things did get ugly</a>. In short, it&#8217;s the result of a lot of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%E8%A9%A6%E8%A1%8C%E9%8C%AF%E8%AA%A4++++++++&amp;num=100">trial and error</a>. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowned_republic">hodge-podge</a> <a class="simple-footnote" title="As our our cells: &#8220;&#8230;several key organelles of eukaryotes originated as symbioses between separate single-celled organisms&#8230;mitochondria and plastids (e.g. chloroplasts), and possibly other organelles, represent formerly free-living bacteria that were taken inside another cell as an endosymbiont, around 1.5 billion years ago.&#8221; [Endosymbiotic theory - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]" id="return-note-30178-7" href="#note-30178-7"><sup>7</sup></a>. It&#8217;s like a nine-hundred-year-old house with fiber-optic Internet access, indoor plumbing, modern insulation, wall-to-wall carpeting, double-glazed windows and, of course, electricity. It&#8217;s warm and alive and clunky. It sounds <em>terrible</em> &#8212; as an idea &#8212; it looks terrible on paper; surely a brand new house, a brand new world, designed and built from scratch, would be better. Supreme hereditary authority that can&#8217;t be exercised?! WTF?!</p>
<p>But it works well&#8230;And not <em>despite</em> how messy it is but<em> because</em> of how messy it is. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Arguably by placing absolute power beyond the reach and use of any human being. You have to be born into it to have it, but you can&#8217;t use it if you do." id="return-note-30178-8" href="#note-30178-8"><sup>8</sup></a>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been paying any attention at all, you&#8217;ll have noticed that the whole story I&#8217;ve just told is <em>riddled</em> with plot holes. Even more so than usual. I can&#8217;t even make fun of <i>Stargate SG-1</i> any more, that&#8217;s how crazy it&#8217;s gotten. I don&#8217;t really know what &#8220;the&#8221; truth is, what &#8220;the&#8221; right answer is. Maybe the truth is more a <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A1%8C%E5%88%97">matrix</a> than a point, more of an <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%8D%E7%AD%89%E5%BC%8F">inequality</a> than a single value. Here&#8217;s an attempt &#8211; an essay within an essay &#8211; <strong>it may well be the case that it&#8217;s not that <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%AB%8B%E6%86%B2%E5%90%9B%E4%B8%BB%E5%88%B6">CM</a> is a good idea <em>per se</em>, but that the kind of phlegmatic, gradualist, one-step-at-a-time, &#8220;<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/calm-down-and-hurry-up">slow down, we&#8217;re in a hurry</a>&#8221; <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/potheads-planners-and-players">mindset that <em>produces</em></a> <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%AB%8B%E6%86%B2%E5%90%9B%E4%B8%BB%E5%88%B6">CM</a> is.</strong> And so CM is just <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%80%81%E5%AD%90%E9%81%93%E5%BE%B3%E7%B5%8C">a surface manifestation of a deeper good idea</a>. CM is the bowl but the real idea is the emptiness, the negative space that the bowl produces &#8212; objective and subjective freedom.</p>
<p><strong>AJATT isn&#8217;t a good idea. It&#8217;s just a vessel.</strong> A bowl. The real idea is: <strong>&#8220;let&#8217;s just try stuff out and keep trying stuff out and whatever works, works, and whatever doesn&#8217;t&#8230;doesn&#8217;t&#8221;</strong>. And there&#8217;s nothing to agree or disagree with, to believe or disbelieve in, because you can&#8217;t agree with nothing any more than you can successfully punch water. Or whatever hackneyed, deep-sounding metaphor you can come up with. Whatevs. <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%81%93_(%E5%93%B2%E5%AD%A6)">The real idea is the emptiness, the absence of a fixed idea, the openness to experimentation</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Hard to articulate. But easy to live and do.</p>
<p><a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/2011/05/protopia/">Kevin Kelly calls it protopia</a>. Deutsch, if I recall correctly, calls it perfectibility, but distinguishes it from the <em><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-organizing-ideas-is-bad-the-power-of-rambling-and-the-tragedy-of-organization">rationalista</a></em> kind that produced so many a failed utopia. The idea is not that you or your situation will ever be perfect. The idea is that <a href="http://is.gd/13j60x"><strong>you can keep improving indefinitely</strong></a>, keep getting even more and more awesome; all your current problems can and will go away &#8212; replaced (mind you) by newer, better, higher and higher quality ones.</p>
<p>History has spoken. Pick your path.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Hello fellow language learners, I am <a href="https://twitter.com/lordsilent" target="_blank">LordSilent</a>, an AJATTeer who participated in the original “<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E8%AA%AD%E6%9B%B8%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%EF%BC%8Finternational-l2-reading-contest" target="_blank">International L2 Reading Contest</a>” and was surprised by the positive boost that reading had on his Japanese in all areas, not just reading. Inspired by this, I kept reading and decided to create what is now known as <a href="http://readmod.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">ReadMOD (Read More or Die) or the 多読 Contest</a>, to share the wonders of reading in your target language with other learners. The words below were written by <a href="http://kazemakase.ca/" target="_blank">Lan’dorien</a>.</em></p>
<p>The human mind is made for nothing more than for using language.</p>
<p>No, that’s not quite right. The human mind is made for nothing more than for communicating with other minds: and language is the tool that it instinctively, automatically uses.</p>
<p>If language then is a tool to a purpose, it makes sense to approach it the same way any crafts-person or artist uses a tool. The pianist tunes and maintains their piano, but doesn’t sit down to press keys; they sit down to make music. The luthier sharpens their tools, but doesn’t set out to push planes and pull saws; they set out to build a guitar. The cyclist adjusts and oils their bike, but doesn’t set out to turn pedals and shift gears; they set out to go for a ride. Past the basics, the use of the tool improves not as a result of concentrating on the tool, but of using the tool for its intended purpose over and over again and letting the natural intelligence of the body and mind refine the process by itself. The human is an amazing creature that will adapt in every way to be more suited to what it is asked to do regularly.</p>
<p>If then you want to be better at a language, simply process more of that language, at regular intervals and in large quantities; and what better way to do that than reading? You are in control of both the pace and the quantity &#8211; no one is rushing you and no one is holding you back &#8211; you can understand as deeply or broadly as you wish &#8211; and there is always, always more text waiting for you, more authors with things they wish to tell you, more worlds waiting to open themselves to you.</p>
<p>The 多読 (たどく, extensive reading) contest has some considerable history already, and last year participants read a total of 228023 pages. Another month’s round begins January 1st. Registration is simple, and explained <a href="http://readmod.wordpress.com/2011/09/21/a-very-%E5%A4%9A%E8%AA%AD-manual/" target="_blank">here</a>. Many languages are supported, and if you like, you can read more than one. You can view scores on the <a href="http://readmod.com" target="_blank">web app</a>, and can report your reading either there or using Twitter. Most pages at the end of the month wins! (the same prize as everyone else, but with a cooler number.)</p>
<p>Now, yes, if you are a beginner you are not going to defeat an intermediate, nor if you are an intermediate are you likely to defeat an advanced learner; but you can pick your own adversaries, your own classes, and have excellent competition between each other; and most importantly you can compete against your own previous bests. Considered as motivation, this contest is best after having participated for several rounds or even several years &#8211; looking back on your score and seeing how far you’ve progressed. And you will progress. Put in the time and it’s guaranteed.</p>
<p>I look forward to reading together with all of you!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8220;The real reason why human beings play sports is to find out how to use our brains.&#8221;<br />
TOMABECHI Hideto</p></blockquote>
<p>This past summer, I tried a bunch of stuff. Including golf. All those &#8220;Cousin Tiger&#8221; jokes I used to tell in high school would appear to have finally come home to roost (inside joke&#8230;long story&#8230;not funny enough make it worth explaining in full).</p>
<p>The last time I played golf was when I was 12, at my friend&#8217;s dad&#8217;s club. This time went way better. I think it helped that it wasn&#8217;t real golf, just chip &amp; putt. Putting is my favorite part of golf. I&#8217;m definitely a putt man.</p>
<p>Har dee har har.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was there moving this ball, enjoying the sea breeze, and it occurred to me how much it was like getting used to a language. Of course, there are the &#8220;organic&#8221; similarities: heterogeneous terrain, distractions, prevailing conditions. But to me, the biggest similarity lay in the fact that <strong>you don&#8217;t do it one shot</strong>. You can try, but <strong>it would be stupid for you to get upset about not making holes-in-one.</strong> So what do you do instead? Just try to get closer to the hole each time. You don&#8217;t get upset; you don&#8217;t throw your club at the nearest old lady or eleven-year-old; you just get closer to the hole each time.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s about all you can do (consistently): get closer.</strong> Putt, putt, putt. Fortunately, though, it&#8217;s all you need to do. All you can do is learn one new word. All you can do is turn on one podcast. All you can do is put your headphones on. That&#8217;s all you can do right now. But it&#8217;s all you need do.</p>
<p>PS: There are probably more <a href="http://is.gd/kLRDYX">golf-to-learning similarities, but&#8230;I&#8217;ll leave those to you and other people who play for real.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey gang,</p>
<p>This is just a little note to let you know that it&#8217;s just come to my attention that we&#8217;re experiencing a major, catastrophic human failure in the AJATT Customer Service system (read: <strong>Veronica in hospital</strong>), so a lot of emails have been left hanging.</p>
<p>This is about the third time this year that you&#8217;ve had to suffer something like this (human and system error causing delays), so I&#8217;m really sorry. Please accept my apologies. We&#8217;re working on getting everything running smoothly and making sure responses get handled &#8212; help is on the way! Reinforcements are being called in right now.</p>
<p>With so many mistakes you know we&#8217;ll&#8230;I&#8217;ll (I&#8217;m trying to dodge responsibility here <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  ) eventually get it right, right?<br />
Right.</p>
<p>Datewise, we&#8217;re looking at having things re-stabilized by November 27.</p>
<p>Thanks for your continued patience and understanding,</p>
<p>Khatz the Somewhat Competent <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s called Biohazard in Japan, Khatz!&#8221;</p>
<p>STFU and leave me alone! Anyway, this is a little update to let you know that a human being named Veronica is now, quite literally, taking care of business as far as <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/contact">support ticket system issues</a> are concerned. Veronica is a real grown-up, with real children. And, well, you know what that means?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right &#8212; she puts out the fires that my wanton, childish incompetence have created; she is order personified and she eats chaos for breakfast and then spits it out like&#8230;sugar cane <a class="simple-footnote" title="I know you. You were thinking: &#8220;here comes an eating disorder joke&#8221;. Well, no bulimia humor for you: it&#8217;s a disease, man, not a punchline&#8230;geez." id="return-note-25727-1" href="#note-25727-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. It&#8217;s like having, I dunno, adult supervision.</p>
<p>So she&#8217;s &#8212; we&#8217;ve &#8212; been at it for 2 weeks now. At this pace, another 2 weeks and everything should be back to normal backlogwise. Again, I&#8217;ll keep you posted on developments. Take care and thanks a bunch for your patience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey there, Tiger.</p>
<p>The recent backend upgrade over at AJATT Plus has made it possible to provide lifetime access to data over there as well. So&#8230;as of today (actually, as of January 27), <strong>the AJATT Library is migrating back over to <a href="http://plus.ajatt.com">AJATT Plus</a></strong>. Since AJATT Plus can now do everything that the AJATT Library was originally established to do &#8212; and more &#8212; it just made sense.</p>
<p>Key benefits for you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The same &#8220;lifetime access&#8221; awesomeness you&#8217;ve enjoyed at the AJATT Library</li>
<li>Faster access to updates</li>
<li>Faster access to add-ons</li>
<li>Single-sign-in: Fewer logins to worry about</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, as far as you&#8217;re concerned, <strong>the &#8220;lib.ajatt.com&#8221; URL simply becomes a &#8220;plus.ajatt.com&#8221; URL.</strong><br />
Your login info will remain the same (it&#8217;ll either be the same as at the AJATT Library or the same as your AJATT Plus account).</p>
<p>Thanks for your support and for being so good-looking. Here&#8217;s to more good times together <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Khatz</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 1 of 2 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/the-great-support-ticket-system-backlog-of-2013" class="series-628" title="The Great Support Ticket System Backlog of 2013">The Great Support Ticket System Backlog of 2013</a></div><p>Hey gang,</p>
<p>This is just a quick note to let you know a little something.<br />
<strong>The support ticket (suptic) system is broken.</strong> Partially in technical sense (overrun by spam), but mostly in a human way (me). In fact, almost completely in a human way; spam is just an excuse. Anyway, AJATT has grown to the point that the sheer volume of requests, both spam and ham, was too much for me to handle personally. Overwhelming load, etc. I know, cry you a river, right? <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>So, two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you created a support ticket of any kind (technical, billing, etc.) between May 1 and June 30, it may or may not have been gotten to yet. Emphasis on the &#8220;not&#8221;.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Someone is being hired right now so that this never has to happen again</span></strong>. More accurately, they&#8217;ve been hired already; they should be on the job by the middle of this week.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Please accept my deepest and most sincere apologies for leaving you hanging so long. It&#8217;s totally my fault, not yours.</strong> Consider it a growing pains thing. And now, for the first time in AJATT history, there&#8217;ll actually be someone competent (i.e. not me <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />  ) whose whole job it is to make sure that your support ticket requests get handled in a timely and expeditious fashion.</p>
<p>Over the next 3~4 weeks, we&#8217;ll clear out the spam, work through the backlog of getting back to you, and get back to getting back to you in a timely fashion. Trust me, that was English.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your continued patience. Will keep you posted as things develop&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/ajatt-server-upgrade-scheduled-downtime">So yeah, server upgrade, <strong>downtime</strong>, read the previous post to get up to speed.</a></p>
<p>The big question is when? The answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start time: March 30, 2013 @ 0630~1230 Japan Standard Time
<ul>
<li>Beginning in this time window, you will start to experience an inability to access some or all of the constellation of server-dependent AJATT sites, subsites and services. Everything from this main blog to Surusu, AJATT Plus and everything else in between are no exception.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>End time (projected): April 6, 2013 @ 1200 Japan Standard Time
<ul>
<li>By this time, everything should be back to normal, with you and I happily sipping smoothies and enjoying hookers and blow at the new AJATT server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, prepare for a few days of downtime followed by several years of bliss <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>
<p>Special Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Special arrangements are being made so that Neutrino core downtime can be on the order of hours rather than days.</li>
<li>Surusu will most likely take the biggest hit in terms of length of downtime due to the sheer volume of users (15,000) and data (many a gigabyte) involved. And also because it&#8217;s free <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />  . But most importantly, to <strong>secure the integrity of the data</strong> and ensure a seamless transition. Ultimately, Surusu will benefit a great deal from all the &#8220;500 Internal Server Error&#8221;s (due to server overload) it won&#8217;t be having on the new, more powerful server.</li>
<li>The whole situation is rather fluid so all this information is subject to change as conditions on the ground shift and/or reveal themselves. I&#8217;ll keep you posted <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  .</li>
</ul>

<p>How are those mothers of yours?<br />
Great, great. Good times.</p>
<p>So guess what? AJATT has grown too big for her britches! Or&#8230;breeches? I don&#8217;t even really know what britches are, but there&#8217;s definitely a size and scale issue going on. Yeah&#8230;a few years online, lots of notoriety, Neutrino and the best SRS in the world will do that for you. So the plan is to upgrade to a ridiculously awesome server so that&#8230;things can continue being even more awesome. Don&#8217;t worry, I don&#8217;t need to know adjectives any more because I can just say &#8220;awesome&#8221; whenever I want to say something is superb.</p>
<p>Like: &#8220;your Mom is superb sauce&#8221;.<br />
↑Free usage example!</p>
<p>No, but, yeah, so the original plan was to have it so that the server would experience no downtime whatsoever and you wouldn&#8217;t even know what was happening back here. But after several weeks of keyboard-mashing back and forth with the migration team at the new superb sauce server, it was decided that it&#8217;s best to just shut things down for a few days, move everything and then&#8230;you know, whatever. That way there&#8217;ll be no issues with some people accessing old data and other people accessing new(er) data. No synchronization issues and what have you.</p>
<p>TL;DR: AJATT may go down for a while. Don&#8217;t freak out; it&#8217;s not an accident; it&#8217;s a carefully planned and executed upgrade by seasoned professionals ( <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  ). She will rise again. Check back in a week or less. <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Also, you look wonderful today. Muah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forgetting and learning are just two sides of the same coin: change.</p>
<p>Forgetting is just a form of change. If you can forget, you can change. If you can change, you can learn. I guess this must be what them experts call &#8220;<a href="http://amzn.com/0143113100/?tag=ajatt-20">neuroplasticity</a>&#8220;. Or not. I don&#8217;t know. Not an expert here.</p>
<p>All I know is, forgetting means that you&#8217;re not static. You&#8217;re not set it stone. You&#8217;re in flux, in motion, constantly in motion, until you die &#8212; and even after that. Your mind, your body, your skills are fluid and mutable. While you&#8217;re alive, it&#8217;s up to you what you flow and mutate (?) them into; <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/its-not-time-its-choice">you have the power to choose</a>. If you can forget Japanese, you can un-forget it, too. It cuts both ways. The trick is to <strong>simply run the process in reverse: do the opposite of whatever it is that makes you forget it.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to forget Japanese is to not come into contact with it. It follows that the best way to not forget it is to&#8230;<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/critical-frequency-a-brand-new-way-of-looking-at-language-exposure">not not come into contact with it</a>. <a class="simple-footnote" title="I know, rocket science, right? Next I&#8217;ll be telling you that the best way to get dry is not get wet. Wonders will never cease. Clearly, I&#8217;m not just Captain Obvious any more: I&#8217;m the Commander-in-Chief of the entire Obvious Armed Forces." id="return-note-22761-1" href="#note-22761-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
<p>So don&#8217;t think of forgetting as your enemy. Don&#8217;t think of it as the opposite of learning but as merely a different form of learning. <strong>You don&#8217;t forget Japanese, you simply learn not-Japanese. </strong>You&#8217;re always learning. The only question is what.</p>

<p><a href="http://AJATT.com" class="autohyperlink" title="http://AJATT.com" target="_blank">AJATT.com</a> &#8212; that&#8217;s this site &#8212; has grown quite  a bit over the years, from its humble beginnings in 2006 to its arrogant, bombastic, decadent present.

You probably came to this site on the enthusiastic recommendation of a pleased AJATTeer <a class="simple-footnote" title="That&#8217;s what we call those who have imbibed the local Kool-Aid" id="return-note-7955-2" href="#note-7955-2"><sup>2</sup></a>. S/he probably told you how awesome this site was, how ridiculously handsome I am, how I changed her/his/its life.</p>
<p>But now you&#8217;re here and you&#8217;re just confused. You&#8217;re overwhelmed. By the sheer volume of information and discussion. How are you supposed to get through this? How are you supposed to read this? How are you supposed to take mine and other people&#8217;s experiences and distill them into a coherent path of action for yourself?</p>
<p>Short answer: Don&#8217;t even try.</p>
<p>I know, you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;WTF?&#8221;, right?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=let+me+'splain&amp;oq=let+me+'splain&amp;aqs=chrome.0.57j5j0l2j60j62.2352&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=8&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#hl=ja&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=d&amp;nfpr=1&amp;q=%22let+me+%27splain%22&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8ZWwUPIzis-YBdvZgKAI&amp;ved=0CCoQvgUoAQ&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=502ac7bbf1ccd471&amp;bpcl=38897761&amp;biw=1241&amp;bih=564">Let me &#8216;splain.</a></p>
<p>You know how like when you get a new cellphone or a new smartphone or a new iPhone, right?<br />
&#8230;Or even new laptop or a new PC or a new computer&#8230;<br />
Or a new iPod or a new MP3 player or a new media device&#8230; <a class="simple-footnote" title="Just think how redundant it would be of you tell me how redundant these examples are, and then come tell me anyway" id="return-note-7955-3" href="#note-7955-3"><sup>3</sup></a>
<p>You don&#8217;t look at the manual, do you?</p>
<p>No. You don&#8217;t. Sane people don&#8217;t look at the manual.</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>You take the device out of the box, you give it a little looksee. Then you turn it on. And you try to get just one thing done. Just one thing. Maybe you try to play a movie. Or set the wallpaper. Or get online.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I want you to do here. At the very least, it&#8217;s what I recommend you do. <strong>Treat this website like an intricately bloated piece of consumer electronics. Yes, this website is a VCR.</strong> Remember those? So, yeah:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey. Nice shirt. You look well.</p>
<p>So, in case you haven&#8217;t heard, this is how it went down.</p>
<p>Back in October, things got a little crazy what with the Neutrino rollout and all (not to mention them hookers and blow). Looking back, the signs had been there for a while. Basically, a straw was placed and the back of the camel was broken: the volume of email here at AJATT finally reached the point where I was physically unable to handle it. Stuff was falling through the cracks like crazy (blame hastily-cobbled-together forwarding and spam filters for that) and it was just&#8230;yeah.</p>
<p>Anyway, I didn&#8217;t come here to whine and cheese you; I can do that on a normal post.</p>
<p>I came here to announce to you the unveiling of a new support system for AJATT. It&#8217;s the AJATT Support Ticket system. The SupTic (yeah, gross, huh?) That&#8217;s right, playa. You get:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear, easy-to-use interface</li>
<li>Less confusion</li>
<li>Better tracking &#8212; no more wondering if your email got to me</li>
<li>Shorter wait times for responses
<ul>
<li>Assuming you get  a response&#8230;hehehehehehehe&#8230;.no, but really, though&#8230;if it&#8217;s like a product issue&#8230;you&#8217;ll get a response. If it&#8217;s  a question about what kanjis are&#8230;maybe not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>↑Those are about the only immediate benefits I can think of right now!</li>
</ul>
<p>So that&#8217;s what&#8217;s news. Oh yeah &#8212; in order to make a clean break, I am also calling an email reset. This means that <strong>if you contacted me on or before October 1</strong>, for any reason, consider your email non-existent. I&#8217;m really, really sorry about that, and wish I could be a manlier for you there. But thank you for understanding. Anyway yeah, <strong>please resubmit your request using the new system</strong>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ultimately, Japanese is an easy language to learn because it has such a well-developed learning support infrastructure &#8212; for regular as well as remedial users <a class="simple-footnote" title="This is AJATTspeak&#8230;verbal acrobatics intended to be helpful. Regular=normal/native. Remedial=L2/JSL=you" id="return-note-6728-1" href="#note-6728-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The trick is tapping into the infrastructure.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what SRS has always been about &#8212; for me, at least: how to exploit &#8212; leverage &#8212; the existing infrastructure, how to co-opt it for our use and benefit.</p>
<p>Not every language has a good infrastructure, even languages with massive user populations and healthy media output. Good luck finding Hindi or Cantonese dictionaries <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>
<p>Having said that, all hope is not lost, even with languages that have less robust infrastructure; with some investment of time and resources, and tweaking of methods, you can create yourself a local infrastructure (=environment) that does the job of creating an &#8220;engineered inevitability&#8221; situation where you&#8217;re getting used to the language in a manageable, repeatable, inexorable way (cf: MCDs). So a system, basically. But one that&#8217;s actually good. One that actually works.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the language, it&#8217;s the infrastructure and how you orient yourself to it.</p>
<p>Anyway, just random thoughts&#8230;about your Mom&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 11 of 11 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/mediocre-excellence" class="series-655" title="Mediocre Excellence">Mediocre Excellence</a></div><blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;beautiful things grow out of s##t&#8221;<br />
~<a href="http://geniusblog.davidshenk.com/rivalries/">Brian Eno</a>, <a href="http://espinozapresents.wordpress.com/2008/09/19/beautiful-things-grow-out-of-shit-brian-eno/">Composer</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Adults focus too much on technique and too little on volume. Too much on technique and too little on frequency. Too much on technique, too little on consistency. Too much technique, too little exposure.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a word for this in Japanese (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4101480125?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;camp=1207&amp;creative=8411&amp;creativeASIN=4101480125&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1328616780&amp;sr=1-1">isn&#8217;t there always?</a>). Well, a phrase: それ以前の問題(それいぜんのもんだい/sore izen no mondai). It means: &#8220;Dude, that&#8217;s not even your freaking problem&#8221;. It means: &#8220;Dude, you don&#8217;t even have the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/max-out-the-cause-card">precursors</a> to be having that problem&#8221;.</p>
<p>You go to the rink. Everyone&#8217;s freaking out about skating right, knee bend, not falling, going backwards. Good. Great. That&#8217;s nice. But you know what? None of that is an issue because most people &#8212; adults and children &#8212; simply have not skated enough ice kilometers, have not been on the ice enough times, for their technique to be an issue. It&#8217;s それ以前の問題.</p>
<p>You go to any discussion about how to &#8220;learn&#8221; (i.e. get used to) Japanese. Real life or online, take your pick: they&#8217;re equally asinine. There&#8217;s always a sizeable faction of <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-many-languages-abandoning-a-language-after-bad-experiences">richardheads</a> waiting to whip out their junk and mind-molest you with the idea that &#8220;anime is bad for your Japanese&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8216;TF? Yeah, and maybe yellow isn&#8217;t a good color for that homeless guy&#8217;s skin tone, but you know what? That&#8217;s not even his freaking problem.  Sore izen no mondai, son. First, he needs a coat. You can go all <em>Queer Eye</em> on him later.</p>
<p>A recklessly adventurous Frenchman has been lost in the North African desert for five days without water. You find him in his car, lips chapped. Sunburned beyond French recognition. He&#8217;s been drinking  his own urine since Wednesday. He turns to you and goes &#8220;please, water, s&#8217;il vous plaît&#8221;. You reach into your bag and hand him a bottle of Volvic. And he looks up, smiles and goes &#8220;Mmmmyeah, I&#8217;m more an Evian man. Volvic&#8217;s kinda bitter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crazy, right? Insane, right? Impossible, right? Madness <a class="simple-footnote" title="SPARTAAAAAAA!" id="return-note-6405-1" href="#note-6405-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, right?</p>
<p>I wish it were. The truth is, crap like this happens <em>every day</em>. Thirsty, pee-drinking Frenchmen rejecting Volvic left and right.</p>
<p>You are a pee-drinking Frenchman. Yes, you. I am a pee-drinking Frenchman. We are all pee-drinking Frenchmen. Even chicks. You&#8217;ve been living in a Japaneseless desert your whole life until now. No water &#8212; no Japanese &#8212; to drink. Not a drop. But now you&#8217;ve reached this massive oasis. It&#8217;s called Japanese pop culture. It&#8217;s got all kinds of flavors &#8212; manga, anime, videos of your Mom, I dunno.</p>
<p>And some <del>faggot</del> <a class="simple-footnote" title="don&#8217;t worry &#8212; it&#8217;s OK for me to say it because I&#8217;m black&#8230;and also a closet homosexual&#8230;I make products with &#8220;spoon&#8221; in the name; there&#8217;s gotta be fire to that smoke. right? I mean, believe you me, I wish I could say &#8220;no homo&#8221; here, but, frankly, there may very well be homo." id="return-note-6405-2" href="#note-6405-2"><sup>2</sup></a>fellow of questionable awesomeness on the Internet is telling you not to drink the water because &#8220;it&#8217;s got sugar in it; it&#8217;s fattening&#8221;. And you&#8217;re going to listen to him?</p>
<p><strong>Do you know why kids get good at things?</strong> I&#8217;ll tell you why. Because they don&#8217;t know how to get into their own way yet. And adults &#8212; parents &#8212; are generally so happy to have the &#8220;rugrats&#8221; <a class="simple-footnote" title="I mean, think about it: &#8220;rats&#8221;! LoL. It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re vermin! It&#8217;s as though parents think their kids are form of household pest!" id="return-note-6405-3" href="#note-6405-3"><sup>3</sup></a> out of sight and out of trouble that they just leave them alone; they don&#8217;t interfere. They don&#8217;t start teaching technique unless and until the kids have a foundation of play and raw exposure.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4838717776?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;camp=1207&amp;creative=8411&amp;creativeASIN=4838717776&amp;ref_=sr_1_2&amp;qid=1328616640&amp;sr=8-2">Yukio FURUICHI</a> puts it best. Apparently, he&#8217;s really good at English. He learned AJATT/AntiMoon style &#8212; by watching <em>Friends</em>. A lot of Japanese adults come to him for advice on how to learn (i.e. &#8220;get used to&#8221; English). They want methods and tools and techniques and tips and pointers and hacks. He tells them (I&#8217;m paraphrasing): <strong>your problem isn&#8217;t technique. It wouldn&#8217;t matter which method you used: none of them would work</strong>, because you simply physically have not been and are not being exposed to enough English. Your raw exposure time[, volume and frequency] is pitiful.</p>
<p>First of all, anime is fine for your Japanese. Trust me. Ask my friends who are learning Hebrew: they wish they had anime. If you&#8217;re into anime, watch the <em>heck</em> out of it. But even if anime were bad for your Japanese &#8212; which it isn&#8217;t &#8212; but even if it were&#8230;you are that homeless guy freaking out over wallpaper colors. Beige or off-white? Who PHEQUING cares? それ以前の問題だろ！Get a house first. Get exposed to Japanese first. Be a jerk about wallpaper later.</p>
<p>Does this make sense? Am I making sense? I&#8217;m still standing here with my keyboard on my lap (standing with my keyboard on my lap, yes&#8230;crazy anatomy here). I&#8217;m still sitting here with my junk in my hand, because&#8230;because I know I haven&#8217;t quite gotten across to you what&#8217;s in my head here. And I don&#8217;t know that I can; I don&#8217;t know if I can, but&#8230;I&#8217;m gonna try anyway.</p>
<p>Are you going to willingly starve to death unless you get caviar? I mean, does it <em>have</em> to be slimy, salty fish eggs for you <strong>or nothing else (!!!)</strong>? Because that&#8217;s what most people who are rejecting anime and showing up and passive listening are doing. Please, at least consider this tuna sandwich. Consider this bottle of Evian.</p>
<p>Supposedly, there&#8217;s some form of &#8220;real&#8221;, &#8220;proper&#8221;, &#8220;correct&#8221;, &#8220;gourmet&#8221;, perfect, inhumanely slaughtered veal/<em>foie gras</em>/Fendi-mink-chinchilla-rabbit-mix-fur-stole version of Japanese that exists somewhere, and nothing but this form of Japanese will do, and anime definitely the HECK isn&#8217;t it and if you don&#8217;t have that exact Fendi stole then you might as well freeze to death; you might as well kill your Japanese baby; you might as well let Japanese die for you.</p>
<p>That kind of junk is what grown-ups do every day.</p>
<p>Stop trying to skate right. Just go to the rink. <strong><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/08/quantity-always-trumps-quality.html">Quality comes from quantity, not the other way around. Quality is the cream that bubbles up from quantity</a></strong>. <strong>Awesomeness comes from mediocrity &#8212; </strong>mediocre- and even crap-looking regularity and showing up. <strong>Cream comes from milk.</strong></p>
