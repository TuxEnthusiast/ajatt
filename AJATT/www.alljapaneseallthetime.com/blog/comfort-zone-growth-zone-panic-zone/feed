		<description><![CDATA[You call it Anglo-Saxon Masochism I know at least one bunch of Japanese people who run a school (for mostly Japanese students, not to learn Japanese) that is ALL ABOUT the panic zone.  They are constantly haranging us about how doomed we are.  It is not helpful.  But maybe it&#039;s sadism rather than masochism.  I haven&#039;t asked the Japanese students how much they have internalized it, but I think a lot (thus masochism).

Anyway, this is good advice.  I only get any work done when I am in an environment where it is socially unacceptable not to be working.  I tried creating more time in that environment but it failed miserably.  One problem with complex jobs is you can take several steps to get started without finding any small non-intimidating tasks to do.  You have to not only gather your tools but reload the entire project into your active memory before you can figure out any small manageable tasks to give yourself.]]></description>
