		<description><![CDATA[Khatz this is a success story based on the above &quot;vodoo&quot;. Ive only been studying japanese hardcore for a year or more,  maybe a few more months, and the progress I&#039;ve made continues to shock me and give me extreme pleasure, deeply learning a language has changed my life for the better in so many ways. Im not at the point of fluency now but i can express endless ideas and can understand maybe 60 percent of what i hear in only a year, and many times more then that, it just depends on the material. The point is I noticed the greatest gains when i put this listening into practice after only  few months i realied soemthing was happening, The language was no longer a jumble of sounds, i didnt know what they were saying but i knew when words all began stopped and sentence structure was being burned into my long term memory as well as words since i was hearing them over and over.

Now, when this was paired with 2 hours reading a day(some days 30 some days 1 hour, ) i realized the staggering power of this method, the ajjat way(I know you don&#039;t likes it to be set in stone).
I am now enjoying Japanese video games, drama(that&#039;s a lot harder at times but ultimately such fun)..and even translating Japanese experiences of people who have had experiences im interested in and then comparing them to western experiences!!

only 6 months ago i could get through a 1 a4 page fairy tale in around 2 hours of immense struggle, now im breezing through them and reading blog posts almost fluently, the only thing that stops me in my tracks in words i haven&#039;t heard. Its extremely rare now i come across a grammar structure or sentences structure that gets me, meanings its usually very rare..

And again, i have to agree and somewhat vindicate you when you talk about (and this is genius) not talking first and how it will simply come trough exposure, it really really does, im online now talking on skeyp to Japanese people and the might have to correct me twice in a  conversation  and they are always shocked at my vocab etc etc...i never EVER practiced talking it just happened, wow thanks khatz let me just tell you all, it can and does work! read, listening, have fun, do your sentences, and enjoy your life in Japanese, but most of all, take it slow and be consistent, the payoff(and im no where near where i want, but now i can clearly see it) is beyond amazing, 

P.S not being employed for a year has obviously helped haha, ive been able to truly dedicate my days to Japanese,  I have even been recently asked by a radio haost to give him my translations of Japaneses near death experiences so that he can compare them to english!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[俺が悪かったなー。最初に「ツイッターもブログも更新しなくていい」って書くべきだった。
これでどうだ？まだ関係ねえのか？ｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
とにかく、別に喧嘩売ってるわけじゃねーよ。ただ、これ以上記事にするほどのネタがあるとは思えねー。
ツイッターの方は、まあ、あいつの事だ。更新しないほどだらしないかもしんねー。　（笑）
あいつのＦａｃｅｂｏｏｋアカウントもそうだ。
「ご苦労」についてはブログを作るだけで、もうご苦労なんだよ。それ以外は、だらしなくてもいいんだ！（笑）
むしろ、最近のネットでこんなブログが5年以上も存在するなんて、不思議な程だぜ。まあ、喜ばしい事でもあるがな。（笑）
あいつがネットから消えようとしても（？）、文句はねーよ。あいつはもう十分やったと思う。
元々、あいつは有名人になるつもりはなかったと思う。（違うかもなー！　笑）
とにかく、俺が言いたかったのはこうだ、「休んでいいんだぞ！」ってな。　:-D
もちろん、勝元様が戻ってくれば、このサイトはもっと楽しくなるけどな。　（笑）
以上。]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love Sowell (in a platonic way). I will read that too. Also, George Gilder&#039;s Knowledge &amp; Power, in which he maintains that Capitalism is an INFORMATION system not an INCENTIVE system. The language application for that would be, I suppose, that free markets are messy, with lots of changes, adjustments, failed experiments and &quot;unapproved&quot; innovations that deviate from experts&#039; &amp; leaders&#039; prescriptions.  It&#039;s bottom-up, not top-down.

That&#039;s why I love Khatz&#039; approach, by the way. He has enough influence and power to seize the language-learning throne, declare himself king, and tell us exactly what to do, but he keeps refusing it, like George Washington, or (Shakespeare&#039;s) Julius Caesar.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You can use the Anki &quot;Hint&quot; feature. I personally find that a lot smarter than making the text color white. Just go to the &quot;Manage note types&quot; in Anki, chose the note type of your lazy kanji deck and click the &quot;Cards&quot; button. In the text field for the front side you&#039;ll see something like {{Kanji}} change that to {{hint:Kanji}} and voi la you get a fancy clickable link saying &quot;Show Kanji&quot; on your front side of the card. No more distracting peripheral vision giving you the outline of the kanji even though you don&#039;t want to see it. As a bonus you can then still see the kanji before getting the keyword answer in case you can&#039;t reproduce it from memory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For some reason, the quote &quot;If you&#039;re in a hurry, take the scenic route.&quot; stuck with me for a long time. Mostly because it didn&#039;t feel right. Of course, I tried to compare it to two students on their way to school saying, &quot;Since we&#039;re gonna be late anyways, let&#039;s just take our time.&quot; But that&#039;s not quite the same, because now they aren&#039;t in a hurry.

Finally, I decided to translate the derned Japanese to my second language, Korean. And now it makes so much more sense.
&quot;If you&#039;re in a hurry, turn around.&quot; So rather than taking the scenic route and stressing on the way while trying to go fast, you just stop. You stop, turn around, and choose to do something else. Maybe it takes you on towards the place you wanted to go. Maybe it takes you to another place, but the thing is, you&#039;re happy.

Thanks Cats!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am almost there myself. I am at 1800 and am losing the will to Heisig. I am fairly certain that I am in need of starting on MCD&#039;s and coming back to the last 200 a few at a time as I learn sentences. I feel that it will jump start my interest and love of Japanese once again. Plus I can continue to review my kanji and just go with the flow!]]></description>
