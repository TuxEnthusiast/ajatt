		<description><![CDATA[I find this 100% immersion thing very difficult. I&#039;m from Norway, so English is not my native language. I want to become an English writer some day, which means I&#039;ll have to surround myself with English a lot. For instance, I&#039;ve set a goal for myself to read 30+ pages every day, something I think has become imperative to my learning, and my thoughts are also in English most of the time.

However I want to become as fluent as possible in Japanese as well, simply because I love the language and I am thinking about living there some day(possibly also write about it). How can I do both? Will I be unable to learn Japanese fluently if I work with my English at the same time, or will it just take longer?
This technique makes it seem impossible to learn more than one language. And what if I&#039;m simply a person who loves learning new languages. If I were to exclude all but one language from my daily life, wouldn&#039;t I just forget the others?
This is not meant as a critique, I just want to learn both languages so badly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I realized that I may have to give up the one thing in the world I love so much I would rather chew my left arm off then give up. So in desperate OH MY GOD freak out mode I googled the movie nightmare before christmas Japanese dubb and there it was! I almost fainted from relief. If nothing else I know I can watch that infinitely without ever getting bored (watched it so much I now know the whole movie word for word :p) no matter what language. I can even replace the english songs on my mp3 for the Japanese ones, so it&#039;s all good!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Daniel, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s nearly as polar as you suggest.

&quot;Every time you’d leave your room you’re back in an English environment. Everything outside is in English, all the signs, all the overheard conversation, all the store clerks, all your friends, your family, your job.&quot; ... &quot;when you’re going to the supermarket to get some stuff to fix yourself a sandwich, that’s like at least a 20 minute mental break back into an all-english environment&quot;

Solution: put some J-pop on your MP3 player, and hop on the bus to the International District for that sandwich.  Even if you don&#039;t go to a Japanese market or restaurant (and decide to hit up that cool new Vietnamese sandwich shop instead), you&#039;re not going to hear or see much English, so you never quite fall back into L1 comfort zone.  As a bonus, it&#039;ll highlight just how much you&#039;ve learned already: &quot;If this was Japanese I could at least read like 2 or 3 kanji on that sign!&quot;.

&quot;On the flip side of the coin you have Japan. Everything outside of your room is still in Japanese; the signs, the overheard convos, the store items and store clerks&quot;

Really?  I&#039;ve known people who have lived in Japan for years and managed to avoid learning more than a handful of words.  Besides, these days, everybody seems to have an iPod in their ears and a book (or Kindle?) in their hands, so even what you hear and see is your own choosing.

One of the big lessons I&#039;ve gotten from AJATT is that immersion is what you do to yourself, not what your environment does to you.  You just have to choose to be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a late reply, but hey, I&#039;m new to the site!

Anyway, I think burning-out happens to the best of us, but it shouldn&#039;t be a problem. Take me for example, I HATE routines so burning-out happens often. But that&#039;s not an issue. For example, say I&#039;ve been working on SRS for a few weeks and am tired of it and feel burnt out. There&#039;s nothing wrong with taking a break because on my hiatus, I&#039;ll just do something else in Japanese!

Also, I agree with Khatzumoto on immersion being essential. But I would think idea of switching over to the target language completely in like a week isn&#039;t the best way for most people.

Khatz and Gerry Garcia may not want to be eased in, but I think for most of us, increasing our immersion environment in correlation to our ever increasing Japanese skill would work better.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am happy with the comments by people saying that total immersion seems quite stupid. I mean basically he is saying, &quot; Hey if you wanna learn L2 completley cut yourself off from L1 unless is a necessity&quot;. I love this site and the things that I learn from it and I believe Katz also said that do what you want and dont look for his acceptness ect. So basically I am not doing a half arsed immersion, I am listening to Japanese music when I feel like it, so about like 3-5 hours a day and learning Kanji from RTK for about an 1 or two. Then srsing it so I basically get home work out and then study Japanese for like 3-4 hours a day and I think that is really all that is needed if you want to obtain fluency in 2 years.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Woah, can I just take a second and say props to Daniel for keeping the conversation productive here? I think this is the first time I&#039;ve ever seen an internet thread get a feisty but flip positive. And no name calling!? Unprecedented. Well done, y&#039;all.

Aaanyway, just wanted to agree that lots of people who come to Japan without knowing any Japanese (that&#039;s what I did) feel something like &quot;burnout&quot; from time to time. I think part of it&#039;s the combo of the new language/new culture/new-job/being-away-from-home hitting all at once.

Not saying that it&#039;s good or bad or inevitable, just saying that it seems to be common. 

I wrote an absurd illustrated list of dealing-with-burnout-tips for a foreigners-in-Japan newsletter a long while back, and after reading this thread decided to pop it online:

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry ya&#039;ll, I didn&#039;t mean to be so negative. I apologize.  Let me start over and offer this advice:

A hurdle I have to overcome with full immersion is comedy.  I think Japanese comedy generally sux.  There&#039;s only so much I can watch of one dude acting like an idiot and saying silly crap while his friend scolds him for it.

So I&#039;ve had a great day (immersion-wise); woke up early, did my reps, listened to all japanese tunes all day, kept my face in books and anime all day, did my daily online newspaper article, it&#039;s all good.  I had a lot of down time at work and I made use of it.  But I&#039;m a little tired and need to take the edge off with a good laugh when I get home after work.  Here&#039;s my dilemma: J-comedy thats starting to really irritate me, or Dave Chapelle.  I gotta risk breaking into English or falling asleep half miffed-off because I can&#039;t laugh out the stress.  If you&#039;re tired of Japanese comedy like me, youtube this: 人を怒らせる方法  &lt;----balls deep funny.  It&#039;ll renew your faith.

Also for you English teachers out there: I&#039;ve came to realize that in school Japanese are taught English strictly through translation.  If given a Japanese sentence, they have translation techniques.  If given an English sentence, they&#039;ve got translation tricks to get it back into Japanese.  We all know this method is indescribably horrible, but this can actually help &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; with your Japanese.  Most of the time when your students are talking in class, it&#039;s not English; it&#039;s Japanese using English words.  So if your vocabulary is decent you can work backwards and get a lot of natural Japanese out of this otherwise painful experience.  For example, when I heard a student say &quot;in the time that has been decided&quot; 「限られた時間」 I finally realized this is how you can talk about having to do general crap outside of your leisure time (someone correct me if I&#039;m wrong).

So if you&#039;ve got a high class load and you&#039;re all pissed off because you can&#039;t get that much Japanese in on that today, don&#039;t despair too much: keep this in mind and you can still be absorbing Japanese even in an English class.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry ya&#8217;ll, I didn&#8217;t mean to be so negative. I apologize.  Let me start over and offer this advice:</p>
<p>A hurdle I have to overcome with full immersion is comedy.  I think Japanese comedy generally sux.  There&#8217;s only so much I can watch of one dude acting like an idiot and saying silly crap while his friend scolds him for it.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve had a great day (immersion-wise); woke up early, did my reps, listened to all japanese tunes all day, kept my face in books and anime all day, did my daily online newspaper article, it&#8217;s all good.  I had a lot of down time at work and I made use of it.  But I&#8217;m a little tired and need to take the edge off with a good laugh when I get home after work.  Here&#8217;s my dilemma: J-comedy thats starting to really irritate me, or Dave Chapelle.  I gotta risk breaking into English or falling asleep half miffed-off because I can&#8217;t laugh out the stress.  If you&#8217;re tired of Japanese comedy like me, youtube this: 人を怒らせる方法  &lt;&#8212;-balls deep funny.  It&#8217;ll renew your faith.</p>
<p>Also for you English teachers out there: I&#8217;ve came to realize that in school Japanese are taught English strictly through translation.  If given a Japanese sentence, they have translation techniques.  If given an English sentence, they&#8217;ve got translation tricks to get it back into Japanese.  We all know this method is indescribably horrible, but this can actually help <i>you</i> with your Japanese.  Most of the time when your students are talking in class, it&#8217;s not English; it&#8217;s Japanese using English words.  So if your vocabulary is decent you can work backwards and get a lot of natural Japanese out of this otherwise painful experience.  For example, when I heard a student say &#8220;in the time that has been decided&#8221; 「限られた時間」 I finally realized this is how you can talk about having to do general crap outside of your leisure time (someone correct me if I&#8217;m wrong).</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;ve got a high class load and you&#8217;re all pissed off because you can&#8217;t get that much Japanese in on that today, don&#8217;t despair too much: keep this in mind and you can still be absorbing Japanese even in an English class.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought it would be easier to read if separated in &quot;paragraphs&quot;. Sorry for the double.

@Ivan the Terrible
I agree completely on the “details” part. This method shouldn’t be taken as absolute guide for success in the way that if someone doesn’t follow this he/she won’t reach fluency. 

But then what would the details be? “Oh, I’m listening to too much japanese and don’t get even a word let alone a sentence.” and other similar “details”? I personally think that details would be: what SRS to use, what headphones to use, kind of sentence I like and other more “technical” aspects.

 I don’t remember as a baby, being able to run to a native language as that native language was precisely what I was acquiring(I’m starting to not like the word “learning” somewhat in this context). Surely, one has to do things in his native language, but only IF forced. I guess that’s the overall spirit of the AJATT. 

In some post, Khatz wrote the following (general idea only): “Learning japanese is easy, just forget that you’re a foreigner.”. How can someone burn-out now?
With all the now-existing high-tech, I think that’s perfectly feasible. By the way,
1. I don&#039;t have money to buy headphones, let alone an MP3 Player and obviously online buyings are out of question. 

2. I don’t use J-J dictionaries because my internet connection is not for 24 hours (besides being 8kB/s AT BEST for downloads), so I use Edict from JWPce. 

3. Almost no time to watch anime and if I can it’s subbed and there’s no “Japanese Item’s Shop” or something like that in the area I live in.

Is any of these stopping me from learning Japanese?

I could just say “Damn, I can’t go on like this, I give up.” and I must admit I’ve thought it a few times (and even stopped for 2 weeks) BUT the love is greater. 

With guys having the opportunity to immerse themselves almost (if not really) 100% in Japanese saying “I burnt out”, I feel hmmm…., I don’t know the word for that in English as I’m not a native speaker but in Portuguese it would be “Zangado”, maybe the word is “Angry”, I don’t know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I don’t see how so many people can “disagree” with Khatzumoto on everything. No offense, but this isn’t a debate forum, and nobody asked for your opinion [if you said something negative]. All Khatzumoto does here, on HIS website, is lay out HIS way of learning. If you don’t like it, the door is right over there…no over a little bit, yeah, that’s good.&quot;

Do you really think the comments section only exists so people can stop in and say, &#039;Yes, Khatz! You&#039;re SOOOO right! I SOOOO agree with every word you say!&#039; ? 

This site details a method that was used by one person to achieve absolute fluency in Japanese in an insanely short period of time. That means it&#039;s got a lot of backing to it, but it doesn&#039;t make it the Gospel of Khatz, with every tiny detail of it utterly beyond second-guessing. The general method can be entirely useful and powerful while people still have differences of opinion on the details.]]></description>

I totally understand the taking a break in Japan when I was there I wanted to freak out cause AJJATT makes your head hurt when you dont think and speak in Japanese, but take a look around buddy you are immersed if your located in Japan and when you walk outside your stuck in the Japanese environment, unless your stuck on a military base which I doubt you are, but for the rest of us who are not in Japan Khatz is giving us a little motivation. I read this post and said to myself &quot;Damn I am being a wuss.&quot; and for me it was all the motivation I needed  to just get back to studying. If khatz didn&#039;t speak in the manner of which he does I wouldn&#039;t even bother with his methods but he talks like a friend by putting us down here and there so we can pick ourselves back up. I in no way doubt you get burnt out over there cause even the simple stuff burnt me out and I would spend whole days stuck watching American television on the STARZ network to keep from going suicidal. Sorry to say though you are whining in your first post so that slightly sticks you in the &quot;wuss boat&quot; with the rest of us. So don&#039;t get upset about a word like &quot;wuss&quot; cause that doesn&#039;t even come close to hanging out with the &quot;sticks and stones.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot; I think taking a youtube break to watch some comedy or listening to English music is a perfectly valid way of taking a break&quot;

I think if you read it he&#039;s saying -not- to take breaks and instead feed yourself more varied and new/interesting things.

&quot;I’m trying to get some feedback on why this is so sinful.&quot;

It&#039;s not &#039;sinful&#039; - there&#039;s nothing catholic about it! :) It&#039;s just in order to get the results, you have to put the time in, and when you&#039;re listening to/watching stuff in English you&#039;re not putting in the time. In one way though you&#039;re right; &#039;sin&#039; is an old Greek term from archery that meant &#039;missing the mark&#039; so yeah, in watching English TV etc., you are definitely missing the mark (of learning/absorbing Japanese).

I say again though, take people&#039;s advice, but in the end, after consideration; do what works for you.]]></description>
