		<description><![CDATA[On the weekends when I am with my son and wife. I always do my kanji review at night, but through out the day I point to things and tell my son what its name is in Japanese or I&#039;ll have my iPhone handy with Kotoba.app just to browse here and there. I do this mainly out of respect that my wife and maybe my son don&#039;t want to be consumed with Japanese all day on the weekends, but I definitely make sure to do &#039;some&#039; Japanese at &#039;some&#039; point during the weekend.

I am going to try the 2mins / hr. exercise... sounds interesting.

I tried doing the &#039;some&#039; Japanese every hour on the hour while I am work but sometimes I&#039;ll get sidetracked by... pfffft, work!

So maybe, by telling my head &#039;2mins only&#039; I might play a trick on my brain and it&#039;ll actually let me go for more than 2mins, like Khatz stated also.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m curious to know though if you think it&#039;s possible to become completely illiterate in a language by letting your frequency drop down to 0 for an extended period of time. Personally, I don&#039;t think you can ever forget &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;of what you learned, but rather just become &quot;rusty&quot; or &quot;stale.&quot; I think that if it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to forget a language that you were fluent in, it would take a longer time than any human lives, but that&#039;s just what I think. Anyways, it was a good read. I liked it.]]></description>
