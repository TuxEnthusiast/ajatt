				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The day you stop sucking at the language isn&#8217;t the end of the journey, it&#8217;s the beginning.</p>
<p>Universities pay full, luscious lip service to this. Graduation is called &#8220;commencement&#8221;, at least in North America.</p>
<p>But lip service it is. Full lusciousness notwithstanding. It&#8217;s said that most peoples learning &#8212; in fact, all nonfunctional reading &#8212; stops the day they leave school.</p>
<p>But you and I are not most people. And I didn&#8217;t come to give you lip service today. My lips are chapped; it wouldn&#8217;t feel good.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-have-you-been-killing-babies"><strong>Baby care doesn&#8217;t end at birth.</strong></a><br />
<strong>Parenting doesn&#8217;t end when the baby can walk.</strong><br />
<strong>So why, as soon as your linguistic baby can walk, are you thinking of abandoning her?</strong> I can hear an objection: &#8220;Khatz! Calm down, son! I need new challenges! New vistas! I can&#8217;t stagnate! I gotta grow! I&#8217;m not abandoning the baby! I&#8217;m just making another one!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tell that to the baby; she feels as abandoned as fork. You forgot she existed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/language-is-friendship-and-familiarity">Don&#8217;t be a deadbeat dad. Don&#8217;t be a neglectful mother.</a> Stay. Stay in your language child&#8217;s life. Milk it. You came all this way just to leave? OK, OK, I know the parental metaphors are a bit strong. But even in purely utilitarian terms, you&#8217;ll gain more from staying and milking than leaving.</p>
<p>Assuming you&#8217;re enjoying yourself, that is. If you&#8217;re really hating life with the language, then leaving might be the best thing. But I find the reasons most people hate a languages they&#8217;re leaving have to do with trying to extract too much extrinsic value from it too fast. Because <strong>fun is more about how than what.</strong></p>
<p>When a language is part of your identity, a lifestyle and not an object, not a trophy, then, ironically, you relax and and have more fun and de-suck (real word) faster. In other words, you get everything you could ever ask for and more, if you just stop acting and feeling so desperate. And that can be very hard to believe. <strong>Surely the best way to hold onto something is to grip harder, right?</strong> How will this kitty know I love her if I don&#8217;t squeeze her until her spine breaks? That&#8217;s the kind of broken &#8212; but apparently reasonable &#8212; linear logic that overwhelms you when you&#8217;re in that desperate state.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some good old personal anecdote for ya: <strong>In 2004, I decided I was willing to spend my whole life and forget English if I had to in order to get good at Japanese&#8230;</strong>it turns out neither was necessary, but the relaxed state of mind that came from my resignation surely had some power to it. And, yeah, there was a short term goal or two in there; there was the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-bilingual-career-forum-story">career fair</a>, but I never saw the fair as end in itself &#8211; in fact, by the time I physically got there, I was already looking beyond it, learning more, doing more reps; <strong>it was never an endpoint, only a waypoint.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why does this type of resignation work? Why does resigning yourself to a lifetime of Japanese work?</strong> Because what you&#8217;ve really done is <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/boiling-water"><strong>give up&#8230;on giving up</strong></a>. And<span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong> if you&#8217;re never gonna give up, then it doesn&#8217;t matter what method you use or how long it takes, and it definitely doesn&#8217;t matter how you look to other people. </strong></span></p>
<p>On the surface, this &#8220;Playa4Life&#8221; mindset goes against everything we know in terms of, say <a href="http://is.gd/ESB3Jj">temporal motivation theory (TMT)</a>. But there are at least three ways to reconcile that apparent paradox. One is to say that<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/timeboxing-trilogy-part-1-what-and-why"> the other equation components get driven up so high as to drown out the gamma</a>. Another is to play fast and loose with both mathematics and common sense, and argue that infinite gamma and small (near-zero) gamma behave the same. And the third (and incidentally, least elegant) way is to just go &#8212; screw it, TMT isn&#8217;t a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory">GUT</a> or <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%87%E7%89%A9%E3%81%AE%E7%90%86%E8%AB%96">TOE</a>, so it must just not apply here.</p>
<p>So, resignation. <strong>Think of it like holding an egg: in order to successfully hold an egg, you need a combination of firmness and softness</strong>&#8230;In order to successfully hold a language,<strong> you need the firmness of frequent contact (immersion and SRS), but the light softness of just having fun</strong> and not freaking the fork out over your situation, your progress, your vocabulary and stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe one day I&#8217;ll start swearing in writing like a real man. Anyway!</p>

Stop&#8230;]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I&#8217;ve been reading about politics and history lately. <a href="http://is.gd/YOvLOm"><em>Voltaire&#8217;s Bastards</em></a>, <a href="http://is.gd/u4ijQw">Amaury de Riencourt</a>, <a href="http://is.gd/bCl6ZN">David Deutsch (<em>The Beginning of Infinity</em>)</a>, stuff like that.</p>
<p>And I came upon something of a&#8230;how can I put this&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fashionable &#8212; and even justifiable &#8212; to roundly dismiss many of the heroes and products of the English-speaking world. Stop riding Newton&#8217;s nuts, Leibniz was just as good if not better &#8212; better calculus notation and a kanji lover. Stop cupping Darwin&#8217;s eye&#8230;balls, he was just kind of OK; he had a theory but no mechanism to explain it in his time. You know, the usual.</p>
<p>Frankly, it&#8217;s one of my favorite pastimes, and I engage in it on a regular basis.</p>
<p>But there are many pieces of Anglophone &#8212; and specifically British &#8212; triumphalism that are actually triumphs; one in particular rarely gets the exposure and credit it deserves <a class="simple-footnote" title="Hint: The answer is not any of the world wars; these were pan-European civil wars whose sole victor, no matter what the textbooks and treaties tell you, was the United States. Without her involvement, they would probably still be fighting in Europe right now. The US literally prevented Europe from &#8220;eating itself&#8221;. Twice. And no one ever said &#8220;thank you&#8221;." id="return-note-30178-1" href="#note-30178-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. And that is the weird, heterogeneous institution that is modern constitutional monarchy and how it evolved.</p>
<p>Um&#8230;like, I don&#8217;t know enough about the topic to actually discuss it intelligently; I don&#8217;t have the vocabulary or background knowledge. <strong>So, I&#8217;ll just tell you how this applies to learning Japanese.</strong> <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/dont-start-clean-start-dirty-why-a-clean-slate-is-bad-for-you-and-what-to-do-about-it">It&#8217;s basically the whole &#8220;starting dirty&#8221; idea</a>, just expressed using political and economic metaphors <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-make-big-srs-changes-the-darwinian-game">rather than biological ones.</a></p>
<p>Good <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A2%E5%AD%A6%E6%B4%BE">economists</a> like Hayek and <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9F%E3%83%AB%E3%83%88%E3%83%B3%E3%83%BB%E3%83%95%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3">Friedman</a> would probably explain it like this: there is implicit knowledge and wisdom embedded and distributed in the market that no central plan or central planner is capable of articulating let alone equaling in quality, precision, quantity and effectiveness.</p>
<p>This same insight was reflected in British culture and politics: there is knowledge and wisdom embedded and distributed in <em>tradition</em> that no overarching manifesto, no theory, no single political ideology is capable of articulating let alone equaling in effectiveness.</p>
<p>Was this insight always right? No. British culture tends to respect tradition to the point of fetishistic worship. But it put the brakes on nice-sounding theories like the French Revolution, Communism (the Russian Revolution) and even the American Revolution, which, for all its big talk, has not truly delivered on the goods; America isn&#8217;t nearly as free a country as it likes to think it is, existing in glaring contradiction with its own loudly proclaimed founding standards. Like Subway marketing itself as health food, America is the best freedom brand of all time &#8211; it has all the cool commercials &#8211; but far greater freedom and far healthier food remain, ironically enough, <em>unadvertised, </em>unmarketed and available <em>outside</em> the Estados Unidos and Subway.</p>
<p>The British constitution is unwritten. You can&#8217;t find it anywhere, any more than you can &#8220;find&#8221; your blood &#8212; it&#8217;s all over the place. There&#8217;s the Magna Carta and a Bill of Rights of some kind somewhere, but, as I understand it, it&#8217;s mostly just implicit &#8212; precedent and all that. Or so I&#8217;m told, I dunno.</p>
<p>Taken at face value, this kind of brazen vagueness seems like a rather delicious recipe for disaster by corrosive, incremental tyranny. Interestingly enough, though, many of the <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%A1%E3%83%AA%E3%82%AB%E5%90%88%E8%A1%86%E5%9B%BD%E5%BB%BA%E5%9B%BD%E3%81%AE%E7%88%B6">18th century English colonists on the American continent who seceded from the mother country</a> thought that individual rights were more or less unlimited and should thus remain unwritten so they could stay unlimited. This anti-codification opinion lost out and the USA grew into a famously legalistic, <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B3%95%E5%85%B8%E5%8C%96">codificious</a> culture &#8212; witness the proliferation of <a href="http://is.gd/VnPlEu">&#8220;mission statements&#8221; in American business training and personal development</a>; in American religion, you see it in <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%E3%83%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%A2%E3%83%B3+%E9%BB%92%E4%BA%BA">the Mormon insistence on making up explanations for things that could have safely remained unexplained and thus prevented a whole lot of bad PR</a>.</p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re here, this isn&#8217;t a put-down of all things American. The truth is that America, like Rodney Dangerfield, gets no respect &#8211; not even from Americans. And when it does get respect, it gets them for the wrong reasons (<a href="http://is.gd/H81Bvv">freedom</a> it <a href="http://is.gd/LMySGN">doesn&#8217;t have</a>, <a href="http://is.gd/wwcsZg">interethnic harmony that only exists on television</a>, and a nationhood <a href="http://is.gd/wwcsZg">built on a foundation of, what&#8217;s the word I&#8217;m looking for&#8230;oh yeah &#8212; genocide</a> <a class="simple-footnote" title="You could say the same thing about Australia as well, and that&#8217;s also a constitutional monarchy/&#8221;crowned republic&#8221;, so&#8230;this whole silly article becomes moot." id="return-note-30178-2" href="#note-30178-2"><sup>2</sup></a>). American marketing techniques and personal development literature are, by far, the best in the world. Yet, as it happens, they tend to be mocked or &#8212; more often and perhaps worse &#8212; simply ignored, to the great detriment of the ignorers and mockers. William James and Ralph Waldo Emerson were the dog&#8217;s bollocks, but <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AA%E3%82%B9%E3%83%B4%E3%82%A1%E3%83%AB%E3%83%88%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%9A%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%BC">brooding, emo</a>, <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BB%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E3%83%BB%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%83%B3%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B4%E3%83%83%E3%83%9B">Old World &#8220;artists&#8221;</a> seem to get all the glory.</p>
<p>Mindsetwise, American optimism continues to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, because the belief that things can be changed for the better makes people take the actions necessary to make that belief come true. Many countries have more entrepreneur-friendly laws, better infrastructure, gorgeous weather and a better-educated populace, but Silicon Valley is still in California, in no small part because that&#8217;s where you&#8217;re allowed to believe in ridiculous things and act out those beliefs during the day, while sober, using real tools and money. And here&#8217;s where it get&#8217;s crazier: if you mess up, it&#8217;s a good thing and you just try again!</p>
<p>This optimism, combined with an almost talismanic reverence for America&#8217;s founding documents produces a steady stream of John Browns, Ralph Naders, Martin Luther Kings, Larry Flynts and countless other entrepreneurs and true believers, ready and eager to bring the documents to life. So there&#8217;s that.</p>
<p>As for marketing, whatever their artistic shortcomings, Hollywood movies are the best <em>sold</em> in the world, a great deal of thought and skill goes into making them make money and the lack of cognizance of and respect for this fact only underscores the intellectual laziness of intellectual snobs &#8211; it&#8217;s childish (not child-like, which would be good, just bratty) to expect a movie to sell well simply because it &#8220;deserves&#8221; to.</p>
<p>By that logic, my mother&#8217;s orange peel chocolate cookies should be the most popular food in the world, but they&#8217;re not, McDonald&#8217;s (OK, rice, but, whatever) is. And, crap product notwithstanding, McDonald&#8217;s marketing, distribution and quality control systems are massive achievements of human thought <a class="simple-footnote" title="And animal cruelty so&#8230;yeah&#8230;awkward." id="return-note-30178-3" href="#note-30178-3"><sup>3</sup></a>, deserving of measured respect and admiration. <em>You</em> try to make billions of servings of food always taste the same and not (instantly) kill people.</p>
<p>Plus, be honest. Do you <em>really</em> want to see <a href="http://is.gd/T3Py8u">some sad, artsy French film</a> with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103616/">no plot and no closure</a>? Really, bro? Really?</p>
<p>Where we? Oh yeah. Learning, sorry, getting used to, Japanese.</p>
<p>The thing about Marxism, the Communist Manifesto, the French Revolution, all these things, is that they seemed so <em>reasonable</em>. So logical. So cogent. So well-structured. So linear. So obvious. So architectonically beautiful. Edifices of the mind. Had I been alive in the right place and time, I would have fallen for and gotten behind every single one of these ideas. <a class="simple-footnote" title="No contest. &#8220;Liberty, equality, fraternity&#8221; versus&#8230;despotic, blingy, in-bred monarch? Are you kidding me?" id="return-note-30178-4" href="#note-30178-4"><sup>4</sup></a>
<p>But they were all wrong. Very badly wrong. Why? Because <strong>for all their superficial complexity, they were actually rather <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B5%8C%E6%B8%88%E4%BA%BA">crude and blunt and simplistic</a>.</strong> They were all straight lines and rectangles: no circles, no curves, and definitely no fractals. No fuzzy bits. No warmth, no character, no squishiness, no personality. No <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-african-way-of-learning-just-do-it">soul</a>. Sort of like replacing all the plants in the world with well-drawn pictures of plants. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Ironically, of course, Marx was a big fan of Darwin; he saw Communism as a societal evolutionary theory and even wanted to dedicate Das Kapital to Charles, but Darwin was like: &#8220;I just wanna be friends, mayn&#8221;." id="return-note-30178-5" href="#note-30178-5"><sup>5</sup></a>
<p>To put it unoriginally: <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/bucolic-wisdom-or-stop-slagging-seeds-silly-city-slickers">life is&#8230;organic. It&#8217;s crooked, cyclical, elliptical. It doesn&#8217;t like your neat little boxes and categories. It sprouts weeds through your perfectly paved concrete. It doesn&#8217;t make Euclidean shapes</a>. It&#8217;s <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AB%E3%82%AA%E3%82%B9%E7%90%86%E8%AB%96">chaotic, in the Lorenzian sense</a>. It refuses to be tamed, to submit to your dictatorial, <a href="http://is.gd/NSASQd">&#8220;top-down, Soviet-Harvard&#8221; rationalism</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Your Japanese learning methods, to work well, need to reflect life&#8217;s organic nature</strong>. The temptation is and always will be to make violent changes &#8212; not bold changes (those are good), violent ones &#8212; to perfectly format your SRS cards, to make everything look and act the same, to make one size fit all, to use schedules and neat little boxes and straight lines, to not even consider trying any idea that hasn&#8217;t appeared in at least three peer-reviewed journals (&#8220;no respected scientist says that listening while you sleep helps, therefore it cannot help, unless and until she says so!&#8221;) &#8212; the same journals that said the exact opposite thing last year.</p>
<p><strong>The temptation will be to respect authority over experimentation</strong>, to denigrate all empiricism &#8212; especially any arising from your own experience &#8211; to do away with your personal traditions (i.e. habits and preferences), to <strong>burn it all down and built it back up from scratch </strong>instead of renovating, extending or just <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/?q=%E6%96%AD%E6%8D%A8%E9%9B%A2++++++++&amp;num=100#num=100&amp;q=%E6%96%AD%E6%8D%A8%E9%9B%A2++++++++">removing furniture</a>. To try revolution before evolution, to be imperious instead of incremental. To <strong>write up decrees and manifestos instead of just tinkering and trying stuff out.</strong></p>
<p>And what&#8217;ll happen? <a href="http://is.gd/u4ijQw">You&#8217;ll be a &#8220;republic&#8221;</a> with your constitution and your rules and your <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9D%E3%83%81%E3%83%A7%E3%83%A0%E3%82%AD%E3%83%B3%E6%9D%91">perfect-on-paper methods and systems</a>&#8230;for about five minutes; you&#8217;ll be a zealot, a monk of your new, perfect religion&#8230;for about three days before devolving into suffering and despotism and forcing yourself to do ridiculously boring things like slogging through some premade Anki deck made from some textbook.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/flame-less-journal-more-win">You&#8217;ll write down what you believe and get into endless, bitter arguments about the minutiae of what you believe, your precious little articles of faith &#8212; as if your opinion mattered &#8212; instead of just living it</a>. Like arguing about what to eat instead of just eating it. Or when chicks spend more time discussing, dissecting and defining their romantic relationships than, well, actually experiencing them and actually <em>relating</em> to the person they&#8217;re supposedly &#8220;with&#8221; (see my new book: <em>Baseless Remarks About Complex Social Phenomena</em> <em>III</em>, for more details).</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll do all that&#8230;</p>
<p>When you coulda just had fun and figured stuff out as you went along and added some parts and removed others. And <strong>yeah, you end up with a &#8220;hodge-podge&#8221; of ideas and tools and methods that doesn&#8217;t look smooth and pretty and is hard to even articulate, but it&#8217;s <em>your</em> hodge-podge, man, and it works for <em>you</em></strong> (WhoTF else matters?!) and it&#8217;s good and you&#8217;re happy and isn&#8217;t that all that really effing matters?</p>
<p>Hard to articulate. But easy to live and do.</p>
<p>The funny thing about constitutional monarchy is that it wasn&#8217;t planned out from the beginning, if at all. It&#8217;s <strong>the result of a lot of winging it</strong>, a lot of fighting and arguing and pressuring and complaining and compromising <a class="simple-footnote" title="Even now, some people see it as merely an unfinished republican revolution &#8212; vestigial despotism &#8212; instead of the accidentally clever and sophisticated separation-of-powers that it is (Spain actually re-instituted CM after shedding its fascist dictatorship&#8230;then again, Italy had a fascist dictatorship with CM, so&#8230;you&#8217;re literally witnessing everything I just said contradicting itself). Just to confuse things even further, Switzerland&#8217;s a republic and it runs like clockwork." id="return-note-30178-6" href="#note-30178-6"><sup>6</sup></a>. In many ways, its development was motivated and accelerated as much <em>by</em> other systems as in spite of them &#8212; royal heads in Europe were rolling with somewhat alarming frequency, and not for the usual royal reasons, either; colonies were seceding. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War">And things did get ugly</a>. In short, it&#8217;s the result of a lot of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%E8%A9%A6%E8%A1%8C%E9%8C%AF%E8%AA%A4++++++++&amp;num=100">trial and error</a>.

It&#8217;s like a nine-hundred-year-old house with fiber-optic Internet access, indoor plumbing, modern insulation, wall-to-wall carpeting, double-glazed windows and, of course, electricity.

It sounds <em>terrible</em> &#8212; as an idea &#8212; it looks terrible on paper; surely a brand new house, a brand new world, designed and built from scratch, would be better. Supreme hereditary authority that can&#8217;t be exercised?!

<p>If you&#8217;ve been paying any attention at all, you&#8217;ll have noticed that the whole story I&#8217;ve just told is <em>riddled</em> with plot holes. Even more so than usual. I can&#8217;t even make fun of <i>Stargate SG-1</i> any more, that&#8217;s how crazy it&#8217;s gotten. I don&#8217;t really know what &#8220;the&#8221; truth is, what &#8220;the&#8221; right answer is. Maybe the truth is more a <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A1%8C%E5%88%97">matrix</a> than a point, more of an <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%8D%E7%AD%89%E5%BC%8F">inequality</a> than a single value. Here&#8217;s an attempt &#8211; an essay within an essay &#8211; <strong>it may well be the case that it&#8217;s not that <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%AB%8B%E6%86%B2%E5%90%9B%E4%B8%BB%E5%88%B6">CM</a> is a good idea <em>per se</em>, but that the kind of phlegmatic, gradualist, one-step-at-a-time, &#8220;<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/calm-down-and-hurry-up">slow down, we&#8217;re in a hurry</a>&#8221; <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/potheads-planners-and-players">mindset that <em>produces</em></a> <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%AB%8B%E6%86%B2%E5%90%9B%E4%B8%BB%E5%88%B6">CM</a> is.</strong> And so CM is just <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%80%81%E5%AD%90%E9%81%93%E5%BE%B3%E7%B5%8C">a surface manifestation of a deeper good idea</a>. CM is the bowl but the real idea is the emptiness, the negative space that the bowl produces &#8212; objective and subjective freedom.</p>
<p><strong>AJATT isn&#8217;t a good idea. It&#8217;s just a vessel.</strong> A bowl. The real idea is: <strong>&#8220;let&#8217;s just try stuff out and keep trying stuff out and whatever works, works, and whatever doesn&#8217;t&#8230;doesn&#8217;t&#8221;</strong>. And there&#8217;s nothing to agree or disagree with, to believe or disbelieve in, because you can&#8217;t agree with nothing any more than you can successfully punch water. Or whatever hackneyed, deep-sounding metaphor you can come up with. Whatevs. <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%81%93_(%E5%93%B2%E5%AD%A6)">The real idea is the emptiness, the absence of a fixed idea, the openness to experimentation</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Hard to articulate. But easy to live and do.</p>
<p><a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/2011/05/protopia/">Kevin Kelly calls it protopia</a>. Deutsch, if I recall correctly, calls it perfectibility, but distinguishes it from the <em><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-organizing-ideas-is-bad-the-power-of-rambling-and-the-tragedy-of-organization">rationalista</a></em> kind that produced so many a failed utopia. The idea is not that you or your situation will ever be perfect. The idea is that <a href="http://is.gd/13j60x"><strong>you can keep improving indefinitely</strong></a>, keep getting even more and more awesome; all your current problems can and will go away &#8212; replaced (mind you) by newer, better, higher and higher quality ones.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 6 of 6 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/the-first-world-problem-is-choice" class="series-650" title="The First World Problem is Choice">The First World Problem is Choice</a></div><p>So, one time, I had to make an appointment with the vet, for my cats, to get special shots for them so I could take them overseas, by plane, and thus have them hang out with me&#8230;overseas, as one does, and then also safely and expeditiously return to Japan.</p>
<p>Now, I had ten choices for an appointment time.</p>
<p>No&#8230;wait, that&#8217;s not what it was. It was a massage place. I think. They actually come over to your house and do, like, sports massage (roll with it) and&#8230;<strong>anyway, yeah, I had, like, ten options.</strong> And too many commas.</p>
<ol>
<li>16:30 Today</li>
<li>17:30 Today</li>
<li>18:30 Today</li>
<li>19:30 Today</li>
<li>20:30 Today</li>
<li>21:30 Today</li>
<li>22:30 Today</li>
<li>23:30 Today</li>
<li>24:30 Today/Tomorrow</li>
<li>25:30 Today/Tomorrow</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, my evening was wide open. And I kind of wanted to keep it that way; I didn&#8217;t want to pick a time that I might end up hating. Plus, what if some of my friends wanted to hang out suddenly? So what was I to do? It was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=barry%20schwartz%20choice">a classic Barry Schwartz, more-is-less situation &#8212; so many choices, so much abundance, so much freedom, so much goodness that it actually makes you feel, well, <em>bad</em>, right? </a></p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>All decisions are binary. And all the decisions that aren&#8217;t binary can be made binary. Here&#8217;s how I did it:</p>
<ol>
<li>I realized that what I had was a sequence of binary decisions to make. So I did a &#8220;reverse&#8221; binary fission &#8212; a weird, binary fusion-fission mix (there&#8217;s probably already a name for this and I just don&#8217;t know it; if you know, please tell me, so I can actually learn something for once!).</li>
<li>First I chose between
<ol>
<li>option 1: timeslots #1~#5 and</li>
<li>option 2: timeslots #6~#10.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>I picked option 1: timeslots #1~#5</li>
<li>Then, since that left an odd number of choices &#8212; five &#8212; I simply picked the middle one, #3.</li>
<li>End of story.</li>
</ol>
<p>Choosing between ten options thus turned into choosing between only two options, two or three times in a row. The same would have applied even if I had started with a number of choices that is a power of two (and were thus always dealing with an even number of choices). So, sixteen options turns into two options of eight, turns into two options of four, turns into two options period.</p>
<p>Eleven options is odd, so it&#8217;s a straightforward &#8220;pick the middle&#8221; (#6) situation.</p>
<p><strong>Put more generally, then, when faced with dozens of choices, you simply group them up (fusion) and then start choosing between increasingly smaller groups (fission) until you&#8217;re down to your one choice.</strong> In so doing, <a href="http://is.gd/6O0mt9">you keep your fish in a barrel, that you may shoot them then and there</a>; you don&#8217;t let them out all over the lake. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=weighted+average+decison+matrix+wadm++++&amp;num=100">I imagine this process could even work when making biggish life choices, like what city to live in next</a>. The group you keep probably contains your true top favorite. <strong>Will your results always be perfect? No, but they were never going to be anyway <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  .</strong> It&#8217;s more important to make decisions well than it is to make good decisions; you can always re-decide &#8212; even tattoos can be surgically removed &#8212; but you can&#8217;t unwaste your time and energy, the very stuff of life itself.</p>
<p>Have you ever had a dream where you had fun, but you also wished you had acted crazier in it instead of spending three quarters of the dream time picking cereal and/or tortilla chips in the supermarket? I literally have dreams like that all the time. In a way, real life is that dream (yeah&#8230;it just got weird in here; I&#8217;m getting <em>Matrix</em>y on you; don&#8217;t be shy &#8212; you know you love it). <strong>You&#8217;re weighing options instead of living them. You&#8217;re picking books instead of reading them. You&#8217;re picking movies instead of watching them.</strong> You&#8217;re thinking about girls instead of making out with them. You&#8217;re reading game reviews instead of playing them. That doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s how life is supposed to work.</p>
<p>Motivationwise, if I were to overanalyze it, I&#8217;d say that I probably have some kind of guilt-driven need to weigh every choice in detail <em>just because I have the choice</em>. Does that make sense? There&#8217;s this feeling that the fact that I have an option means I must do &#8220;due diligence&#8221; on it, in order to find out whether or not it&#8217;s the best, otherwise I&#8217;d be wasting a &#8220;perfectly good&#8221; option; I&#8217;d be &#8220;missing out&#8221; and/or &#8220;messing up&#8221; somehow. It&#8217;s sort of like sampling every single kind of ice-cream at an ice-cream parlour <em>just because they say you can</em>. Yeah, you sucked up all the &#8220;value&#8221; you could, but so what? You just get all full and don&#8217;t really enjoy yourself. <a class="simple-footnote" title="The big butter popcorn at the movie theater concession stand (WTF are they conceding?!) may be only a dollar extra, but there&#8217;s so much of it that no longer even feels good, so you&#8217;re simply paying an extra dollar for the dubious privilege of feeling bloated and greasy. Nice one." id="return-note-30135-1" href="#note-30135-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
<p>This kind of trying-to-be-optimal &#8220;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%E3%83%9B%E3%83%BC%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA+%E3%82%B4%E3%83%9F%E5%B1%8B%E6%95%B7+++++++&amp;num=100">choice hoarding</a>&#8221; actually turns out to be the most suboptimal thing you could possibly do; it produces the most fatigue and the least happiness. If you really want to be happy, it seems like the trick is to <em>throw out</em> some of your choices ASAP. Take them out of the Reeves-Hopper equation (there&#8217;s a Sandra Bullock joke in there for the diligent). Kind of like how if you really want to live happy, you <em>don&#8217;t</em> fill your house with stuff even if you have tons of space.</p>
<p><strong>Binary decision-making &#8212; decision binarization &#8212; gives you the feeling of having considered a choice, and thus exercised your freedom to the fullest, without the temporally and cognitively wasteful burden of actually running through a full mental simulation for it. </strong>It is absurd to attempt to actually weigh every choice you have, just as it would be absurd to even consider opening every page that Google sends you back in search results; as it is, you probably don&#8217;t even open all of the first ten. So apply some googolic wisdom to your real life and stop overthinking everything &#8212; because you can&#8217;t and even if you could, it would not be a good thing. Remember, there will be a next time; you will get another shot. This is not a movie; in real life, the chances keep coming, and when they go, new ones fire right on up and take their place. Make your &#8220;best bad&#8221; decision now and run with it.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been paying attention, you&#8217;ve probably noticed that<strong> decision binarization is really just a highly specific form of <a href="http://goo.gl/6Im3184">satisficing</a></strong>: &#8220;Aiming to achieve only satisfactory results because the satisfactory position is&#8230;hassle-free, and secure, whereas aiming for the best-achievable result would call for costs, effort&#8230;&#8221;. A satisficing algorithm, if you will.</p>
<p>In the end, then, Barry Schwartz and I are pretty much on the same page&#8230;I&#8217;ve never actually read his work in detail, though. My impression, unsullied by actual research, is that he wants choices reduced for us by default? <strong>I like to be the one doing the reduction, though. There&#8217;s a world of difference between being forced to live healthily and choosing to do so.</strong> It&#8217;s only discipline if you choose to do it, anything else is just oppression. Like, I choose what English words to use, but I don&#8217;t want English to actually have fewer words just because some apparatchik decided so. I choose what to buy; I don&#8217;t want there to actually be fewer options period <em>*cough*</em> rhymes with Bamazon Banada <em>*cough*</em>. Having said that, I&#8217;d appreciate less crud out of the box on Android phones and Windows computers; imitate Apple&#8217;s core genius, not just its surfaces.</p>
<p>P.S: The massage itself was really good. Massage, for me, is always one of those things I fuss about whether or not to get beforehand (latent miserliness &#8212; it feels so <em>decadent</em>), but <em>never</em> regret after the fact. I mean, there was that one time in 2006/2007 where the guy was, like, cuh-lueless &#8212; almost as bad as a massage chair&#8230;no, worse: it was like being <em>bullied</em> by a legally registered bullier &#8211; but other than that every single time has been super good. As a matter of fact&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You are not a screw-up. You are not lazy. You work hard. Too hard. At things that don&#8217;t matter. You work hard at struggling and self-blame and self-hate. You work hard at worrying. You work hard at pacing the floor. You work hard at imagining terrifying, low-probability contingencies. You work hard on trying to force yourself, like a stubborn camel, to do things you don&#8217;t want to do in a way you don&#8217;t want to do them.</p>
<p>And it doesn&#8217;t work. It almost never works.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>USE EVEN MORE FORCE! You tell the whole world your goals, in order to force social pressure onto you. You write yourself expletive-laden notes, memos and messages. You use all-caps so that you DON&#8217;T FORGET. You try to get yourself to be a gentleman, to be a lady, to be more cultured, more civilized, by being increasingly cruel and uncivil and ungentle to yourself.</p>
<p>And therein lies the problem. You&#8217;re violating the very principles you claim to value in order to instill those same principles. Sort of like a parent screaming: &#8220;STOP F###ING SWEARING!!!!&#8221;. Sort of like violently invading a country and then imposing military rule on it, in order to turn into a peaceful, pluralistic, self-sustaining democracy. It would be comical if you weren&#8217;t so serious about it.</p>
<p><a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%99%E3%83%AB%E3%83%88%E3%83%BB%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3">Did not the man of one stone </a>tell us that you can&#8217;t solve a problem at using the same level of thinking that created it? <strong>You can&#8217;t beat and berate yourself into finesse. You can&#8217;t scare yourself into calming down.</strong> <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/beyond-binging-and-purging-why-you-maybe-shouldnt-try-overcorrecting-for-when-you-screw-up">You can&#8217;t binge yourself into balanced behavior</a> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Which is probably why crash diets don&#8217;t work, at least behaviorally. Apparently there are some metabolic issues with them as well." id="return-note-29804-1" href="#note-29804-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Try this on for size: everything you do is right. Even when it&#8217;s wrong. Everything you do is right. <strong>Everything you do is <em>structurally</em> right. </strong>How do I know? Because you&#8217;re doing it.<strong> If it weren&#8217;t structured right, you couldn&#8217;t do it, you wouldn&#8217;t do it, and you wouldn&#8217;t keep doing it.</strong></p>
<p>Everything you do is a solution to a problem. The solution you&#8217;re choosing may be misguided, laborious and/or counterproductive, but it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that you were sincerely trying to solve a problem. You are a good person who sometimes picks (very) bad solutions.</p>
<p>Everything you do is right. It may or may not be misguided, but it&#8217;s right. So when you watch TV instead of touching that important project? You did a (not the, but a) right thing. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-accomplish-great-things-small-victories-winnable-games">The solution is simple: <strong>make the thing you&#8217;re &#8220;supposed&#8221; to be doing more like watching TV. (Re-) model your desired behavior on your avoidance behavior</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Your avoidance behavior is pointing you to something; your avoidance behavior is structured in such a way that makes it fun, and what&#8217;s more, this structure is independent of the actual content of the behavior. Make your &#8220;work&#8221; function and proceed like &#8220;play&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s something of an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: You keep looking up <a href="http://Cracked.com" class="autohyperlink" title="http://Cracked.com" target="_blank">Cracked.com</a> or <a href="http://TVTropes.org" class="autohyperlink" title="http://TVTropes.org" target="_blank">TVTropes.org</a> instead of doing Japanese.
<ul>
<li>Solution 0: Feel guilty and berate yourself. Do it hard, so you feel like a total schmuck and don&#8217;t want to do anything (let alone keep living) any more. This is what you and most other people typically do. Hint: stop choosing this one.</li>
<li>Solution 1: Find a Japanese equivalent to <a href="http://Cracked.com" class="autohyperlink" title="http://Cracked.com" target="_blank">Cracked.com</a> (or <a href="http://TVTropes.org" class="autohyperlink" title="http://TVTropes.org" target="_blank">TVTropes.org</a>)</li>
<li>Solution 2: Google Japanese websites that talk <em>about</em> <a href="http://Cracked.com" class="autohyperlink" title="http://Cracked.com" target="_blank">Cracked.com</a> (or <a href="http://TVTropes.org" class="autohyperlink" title="http://TVTropes.org" target="_blank">TVTropes.org</a> or whatever) and how funny it is</li>
<li>Solution 3: Google Japanese discussions (blogs, vlogs, fora, books, etc.) about one or more of the weird topics you find yourself reading and laughing about on <a href="http://Cracked.com" class="autohyperlink" title="http://Cracked.com" target="_blank">Cracked.com</a> (or <a href="http://TVTropes.org" class="autohyperlink" title="http://TVTropes.org" target="_blank">TVTropes.org</a>). There are plenty of Japanese websites about weirdness in movies and surprising scientific phenomena and whatnot. In fact, because Hollywood movies are a foreign (if common) phenomenon in Japan, Japanese viewers are even more naturally able to &#8220;step outside&#8221; them and point out the unconscious clichés, genreisms and strangely recurring lines of dialog.</li>
<li>Solution 4: Roll your own. Make up something weird but easy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The point is, <strong>don&#8217;t look away from what you&#8217;re doing &#8220;wrong&#8221;</strong> as if it were some dirty, shameful thing, like a regretfully randy hook-up that you&#8217;re now embarrassed about. <strong>Look at it</strong> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Kind of like how you look at the solids and liquids that come out of your body (don&#8217;t make me get specific) with child-like curiosity." id="return-note-29804-2" href="#note-29804-2"><sup>2</sup></a><strong> deeply and <em>directly</em> and from many angles and see how you can use (part of) it for good</strong> &#8212; like using nuclear power for electricity instead of burning children and teddy bears.</p>
<p>We tend to talk and get upset about what we&#8217;re <em>not</em> doing, as if our &#8220;non-productive&#8221; times were spent in a state of catatonia, holding rigid for hours, staring at a wall, literally doing nothing. But we&#8217;re actually always doing something. We talk about how we&#8217;re &#8220;not practicing Japanese&#8221;, when in fact we are simply practicing English. <strong>We are always doing <em>something</em></strong>, and if we&#8217;re not doing something else, it&#8217;s because that something else is very poorly structured, because if it were correctly structured&#8230;we&#8217;d be doing it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/japanese-is-useless-and-a-waste-of-time-stop-learning-it">&#8220;But I <em>have to</em> do the work, Khatz!&#8221;, you protest. Do you? You <em>have to</em> learn Japanese? No, you don&#8217;t. You could <em>not</em> do it.</a> In fact, you&#8217;re already not doing it right now. And you&#8217;re still alive. You don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to do anything. Other people tell you that just to get you to STFU and follow their orders. <strong>Pretty much the only thing you <em>have</em> to do is breathe, and yet that&#8217;s one of the first things you stop doing</strong> &#8212; worried people tend to take very shallow breaths, as well as subconsciously hold their breath &#8212; as soon as you&#8217;re a bit scared. I&#8217;m not saying they won&#8217;t try to do mean things to you in order to get you to do the thing you didn&#8217;t do, but that just means new situations and new choices.</p>
<p>So how do you turn &#8220;work&#8221; into &#8220;play&#8221;? I do not know exactly; each situation varies. But here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out a way to avoid doing it altogether. Like, totally not do it at all, not simply delay it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Failing that&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Small time increments (pico-tasking, microtasking instead of multitasking &#8212; in other words, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/timeboxing-trilogy-part-1-what-and-why">timeboxing</a>)</li>
<li>Focus on the now, not on the big picture.
<ul>
<li>What? Yes. Focus on the now, not on the big picture? Isn&#8217;t that dangerous, though? No, not if the small picture is a part of the actual big picture you want.</li>
<li>The problem we have right now is that <strong>everyone at least vaguely knows what big picture they want, but almost everyone SUCKS with a capital &#8220;S&#8221; at picking small pictures that produce that big picture</strong>. So they instead pick completely irrelevant small pictures or (worse) small pictures that look like the big picture.</li>
<li>Think about it, though &#8212; <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/quantity-time-is-quality-time">a picture of Reese Witherspoon isn&#8217;t made up of other pictures of Reese Witherspoon; it&#8217;s made up of pixels that look nothing like Reese Witherspoon. </a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/quantity-time-is-quality-time">Your cells aren&#8217;t little people; they look and act and live and die nothing like you. Similarly, <strong>your small picture actions will look or feel almost useless</strong> <a class="simple-footnote" title="like Wayne Gretzky (apparently) inexplicably skating into open, puckless space." id="return-note-29804-3" href="#note-29804-3"><sup>3</sup></a></a> <strong> &#8212; </strong>not counterproductive, just comically piecemeal; this happens to be precisley how learning kanji shape and meaning without learning readings, Heisig style, feels to most people. &#8220;This is too small! This is too easy! This is too little and too late! There&#8217;s no <em>way</em> this could help! So I&#8217;m gonna go back to watching English language TV&#8221; (which, ironically, is less than 0% effective at improving your Japanese&#8230;it&#8217;s weird&#8230;<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/failing-gracefully">choosing 0% [or less] instead of 0.1%</a>). <a class="simple-footnote" title="We constantly abandon the now and the good enough in pursuit of the perfect, but, if you play the etymology game, to be perfect (think: perfect tense) means to be complete, finished, done with &#8212; dead. Nothing that lives, that is alive and growing and changing can be perfect. Perfection is death. Maybe that&#8217;s why we love people so much when they&#8217;re dead   ." id="return-note-29804-4" href="#note-29804-4"><sup>4</sup></a>
<ul>
<li>This useless feeling is a false intuition. Kind of like how the Earth doesn&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s moving or spinning even though it&#8217;s doing both. Small picture actions, if well-directed, will be anything but useless.
<ul>
<li>How do you know how to correctly direct your small picture actions? Easy. Let&#8217;s say your getting used to Japanese. Your question is: &#8220;can I hear and/or see Japanese right now?&#8221;. If you can answer in the affirmative, then you&#8217;re direction is perfect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Furthermore, small picture actions will, if well-structured, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-accomplish-great-things-small-victories-winnable-games">be a lot of fun</a> &#8212; more fun, even, than our typically-considered-as-fun entertainments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I know this small picture/big picture thing kinda contradicts the<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/before-fluency-after-fluency"> Before Fluency/After Fluency quasi-enlightenment thing</a>&#8230;deal with it <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://is.gd/tmHpu4">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi of Flow</a> fame offers: &#8220;<a href="http://is.gd/IVYs4i">the more a job inherently resembles a game &#8212; with variety, appropriate and flexible challenges, clear goals and immediate feedback &#8212; the more enjoyable it will be regardless of the worker&#8217;s level of development</a>&#8220;.
<ul>
<li>Which, if you think about it, is the same as the idea of <a href="http://goo.gl/hPRhy">&#8220;SMART&#8221; goals, minus the boorish preachiness.</a></li>
<li>&#8230;And is also the same as the idea of <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-accomplish-great-things-small-victories-winnable-games">&#8220;winnable games&#8221;.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t ever try to get the whole thing done. That&#8217;s like trying to clear every screen, every boss and every level of a video game all at once by pushing one button</strong> (and, oh, <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%94%BB%E7%95%A5%E6%9C%AC">never doing any research, because we all know that&#8217;s a waste of time(!)</a>). Just move forward.</li>
<li>Ask better questions: Not &#8220;why can&#8217;t you just get this done?!&#8221;.
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re not sure how dumb your questions are, try strategically replacing their key nouns with nouns like &#8220;FIFA&#8221; and &#8220;World of Warcraft&#8221;. So, like:
<ul>
<li>&#8220;why can&#8217;t you just stop dallying and get your <em>FIFA</em> playing done?!!&#8221;;</li>
<li>&#8220;why don&#8217;t you ever play <em>WoW</em> like you&#8217;re supposed to?!&#8221;;</li>
<li>&#8220;would it kill you to just finish a game you started once in a while?!&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&#8230;and you&#8217;ll see how saying things to yourself like: &#8220;I gotta get this all done NOW!&#8221; or &#8220;I shoulda had this done by now!&#8221; or &#8220;I shoulda got this done yesterday&#8221; is so transcendantally stupid, dangerous and useless.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Games are not inherently interesting, only structurally interesting. Copy the structure &#8212; variety, flexible challenges, clear goals, immediate feedback &#8212; reverse-engineer the Steele equation, and you win.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I met a German girl at a cafe today&#8230;actually, she was Austrian but, same difference. Anyway, we got to talking about books and  I gave her a <a href="http://is.gd/VFeg84">book recommendation</a>, and it came out that I&#8217;ve only ever read the book in Japanese, so I had to find out what the English title was. She was shocked (or maybe surprised&#8230;whatever, same difference), and she talked about how she could never learn Japanese. And I was like, no way, of course you could.</p>
<p>Because, here&#8217;s the thing. I have a lot of positive stereotypes about German people. There was my friend and neighbour Wolfgang (actual name), who would slice, spread, lay out and eat his afternoon teatime Nutella baguette slices with ruthless &#8211; almost mechanical &#8212; forethought, precision and efficiency. And then there&#8217;s the punctuality thing, of which I am a big (if imperfect) fan. If you send me an email, Heaven help you, but if we have a face-to-face meeting, I will be there a good ten minutes before time, and that&#8217;s in large part thanks to the influence of my German friends in college; I slept with dogs and caught their fleas.</p>
<p>Now I just likened a group of people to dogs&#8230;no good can come of this.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>The point is, I like to think that I learned Japanese &#8220;like a German&#8221;, that is, in a calm, directed, systematic, way. Of course, I wung it where winging it was appropriate and effective &#8212; I was systematic, not mechanical; I&#8217;m too lazy to be mechanical &#8212; that&#8217;s why I have the SRS be mechanical for me. I tackled finite, clearly defined tasks &#8212; kanji, cards &#8212; with unstoppable forward motion.</p>
<p>And yet, you won&#8217;t hear much talk of vocabulary lists here at AJATT. Why is that? Are they evil?</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s a lot more complicated than that. Live in East Asia for a while, and you&#8217;ll overcome your desire to classify everything into two categories, where one has completely (or even mostly) positive attributes and the other equally and oppositely negative ones. The<a href="http://www.kyoto.zaq.ne.jp/dkadg206/bg2/alignment.html"> character alignment system</a> that I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://suesuo.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-58.html">seeing around the Internets lately</a> goes a long way toward helping people outgrow this.</p>
<p>Back on topic.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s Right With Vocabulary Lists</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They imply (correctly and helpfully) that the language is finite and tractable
<ul>
<li>Human language is &#8212; thankfully &#8212; capable of infinite variation, but all those permutations and combinations are based on repeating a large but finite set of parts. There are an infinite number of numbers possible, but only ten digits in the Arabic numeral system. Similarly, there are only about two hundred (give or take) repeating parts in the kanji system. There are only about four hundred possible sounds in Mandarin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They give you something to focus your attention and energy on (instead of free-floating anxiety and self-loathing)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/mastery-is-mastering-the-basics">Can help people to focus on simple, foundational knowledge &#8212; the basics, whose mastery is the essence of mastery itself</a></li>
<li>They&#8217;re really good for handling small subsets of the language, like days of the week and months of the year</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s Wrong With Vocabulary Lists</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In a nutshell: people and how they use them</li>
<li>People start to feel wedded to their lists</li>
<li>People feel obligated to go through every single word in the list. This is bad. Stop as soon as bored.
<ul>
<li>Doing good in one area is not license to do harm in others
<ul>
<li>Yes, a surgeon gets to cut you up so he can heal you, but just because your parents feed and clothe you, doesn&#8217;t mean they get to beat and rape you as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Similarly, just because a word is on your vocabulary list, exists in the language and is &#8220;useful&#8221;, doesn&#8217;t mean you have to suffer and bore yourself in order to &#8220;learn&#8221; it</li>
<li><strong>Every word you don&#8217;t know in a document you want to read (or that is about a topic you&#8217;re interested in, e.g. the <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%94%BB%E6%AE%BB%E6%A9%9F%E5%8B%95%E9%9A%8A"><em>Ghost in the Shell</em> entry in L2 WikiPedia</a>) is <em>already</em> an implicit vocabulary list</strong></li>
<li>Even the best rugby players don&#8217;t try to tackle two people at the same time (in part because you&#8217;re only allowed to go for the guy with the ball&#8230;I think). So tackle one and only one word at a time, one and only one article at a time.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t learn a language, you learn quanta &#8212; sounds, words, phrases</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learning single words without context
<ul>
<li>A word is almost meaningless without its context</li>
<li>A word without context is multiple accidents waiting to happen</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learning words between languages as though a one-to-one correspondence existed. It simply doesn&#8217;t, not even at the simplest level, not even between closely related languages like English and French or Mandarin and Cantonese.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How To Use Them Without Being Used By Them</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use vocabulary lists the way you use the TV guide &#8212; as a starting/focal point to your viewing experience, not as an ultimate authority</li>
<li><strong>Every word you don&#8217;t know in a document you want to read (or that is about a topic you&#8217;re interested in, e.g. the <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%94%BB%E6%AE%BB%E6%A9%9F%E5%8B%95%E9%9A%8A"><em>Ghost in the Shell</em> entry in L2 WikiPedia</a>) is <em>already</em> an implicit vocabulary list &#8212; use that</strong>. So&#8230;you don&#8217;t actually need an explicit list. Every document is a list.</li>
<li>Never learn words out of context, always in the context of a phrase</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more I wanted to say (this post is based on something I spoke into a voice recorder), but I can&#8217;t be bovvered to type it out, so&#8230;more later <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>

<p>Detailed Version</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a newspaper &#8212; preferably a dead-tree one</li>
<li>Pick out a headline (or an interesting-looking article, picture, caption, whatever)</li>
<li>Google the headline</li>
<li>Find the article online</li>
<li>Look up and learn any words you don&#8217;t know in the headline</li>
<li>Use the article for clues (meaning of abbreviations, etc. &#8220;Govt&#8221; = &#8220;Government&#8221;) if necessary.</li>
<li>Create an MCD card containing the headline and the first three paragraphs of the adjoining article &#8212; the article that the headline belongs to
<ol>
<li>The headline and first three paragraphs belong on the <em>front</em> of the card, the paragraphs will provide extra context, clues and cues &#8212; otherwise, all you&#8217;ve got is a disembodied headline, and nobody wants that.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Hide (cloze) the words you didn&#8217;t know
<ol>
<li>Obviously, after putting their dictionary definitions (monolingual or bilingual, your choice) and pronunciation aids (if necessary) onto the <em>back</em> of the card</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t worry about understanding the whole article or knowing every word in the article. MCDs allow partial ignorance (partial knowledge). The sum of your partial knowledges will add up to complete knowledge.</li>
<li>Stop for now  &#8212; we&#8217;re trying to keep things simple, finite and tractable &#8212; make it into a winnable game &#8212; by focussing only on headlines (and on only one a day)</li>
<li>Repeat from (1) tomorrow &#8212; keep going until you stop running into headlines you can&#8217;t understand.</li>
<li>Vocabulary lists? You don&#8217;t really need them &#8212; the words you don&#8217;t know <em>are</em> your vocabulary list</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, the process is daunting, but it is finite and thus tractable. So just do one headline every day. Never deal with all your ignorance at once; only handle one bite at a time, one link at a time in the chain of destiny.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8220;Mallory is famously quoted as having replied to the question &#8220;Why do you want to climb Mount Everest?&#8221; with the retort &#8220;Because it&#8217;s there&#8221;&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://goo.gl/57xw">[George Mallory - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Growing up, I had the privilege of interacting with people from a wide range of social classes on a daily basis. I didn&#8217;t think too much of it at the time; I thought that&#8217;s just how the world worked. It was&#8230;well, it just seemed like it was what it was.</p>
<p>But now I realize that what it was&#8230;was edifying.</p>
<p>While I actually had the benefit of observing this kind of thing first-hand, first-hand observation really isn&#8217;t necessary; you could just imagine it. In any case, I noticed a lot of big talk and overbite among aristocrats, and I noticed a lot of plodding, action and drinking among builders.</p>
<p>Aristocrats &#8212; and people who think like them &#8212; have courage and vision but lack even basic knowledge and all sense of practicality; they are deeply disconnected from reality.</p>
<p>Builders lack all sense of vision. They&#8217;re too busy laying bricks, too busy going to through the motions to really step back and wonder why and wherefore. They&#8217;re too busy moving to think where they&#8217;re going. &#8220;Too busy making a living to get rich&#8221;, as Dan Kennedy once quipped, paraphrasing someone else. But they are willing and able to work, and if simply given a direction, they will move in it.</p>
<p>Case in point: everybody, everywhere is learning a language. You are &#8220;learning&#8221; English right now, reading this. Right now, every single human being, everywhere in the world, is learning a language. He&#8217;s practicing it; he&#8217;s building new vocab, making new connections; he&#8217;s reinforcing it; he&#8217;s dreaming in it. So<strong> everybody is a language laborer. The only question is, what is the <em>direction</em> of your labor?</strong> It&#8217;s not whether or not you&#8217;re laboring at a language, because you are, the only question is <em>which</em> language.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fashionable to put down aristocrats and pedestalize working class values. The opposite used to be the case. But <strong>both approaches are going to get you nowhere.</strong> Acting too aristocratic will kill you quickly in a blaze of glory; acting too working-class will kill you slowly from the inside and out, wearing you down with purposeless drudgery and struggle-for-the-sake-of-struggle. Aristocratic thought will give you direction but get you nowhere; working class action will lack bold and overarching direction, and thus also get you nowhere.</p>
<p>Mountaineer George Mallory wasn&#8217;t titled or anything, to my knowledge, but he did go to Winchester and Cambridge, so he&#8217;s pretty durn aristocratic. And that&#8217;s why he could do such Churchillian one-liners in praise of uselessnes. Even though (or perhaps because) I&#8217;m afraid of everything, and don&#8217;t myself climb or do anything remotely brave or dangerous, I&#8217;ve been reading quite a bit about moutaineering lately. And something hit me in my reading of books like the controversial <a href="http://is.gd/HX3V9X"><em>Into Thin Air </em>(空へ)</a> and <a href="http://is.gd/cwaC7A">that other Russian guy&#8217;s book</a>.</p>
<p>What follows is all second- and third-hand information filtered through my Khatzumoto fact distortion field, so feel free to correct me if you know better. Here it is.</p>
<p>One doesn&#8217;t &#8220;climb&#8221; Everest. That is, the people who &#8220;climbed&#8221; Everest didn&#8217;t really climb it. Not in the heroic, one-man one-mountain, ice-pick and crampon way that we tend to think.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>Sherpas climb Everest. They take virtually all the real risks; theirs is the highest death rate; they lay the rope; they set up the ladders; they carry the food and oxygen and all the other luggage; they set up the tents at each of the camps along the way. Sherpas set up everything; the whole infrastructure. And then everybody else kinda sorta <em>hikes</em> Everest.</p>
<p>But someone needed to give the Sherpas direction, to make it worth their while, to encourage them to dare to be stupid, to get them excited and fired up &#8212; because they&#8217;re just as up for adventure and derring-do as anyone else &#8211; and those someones are, literally and figuratively, <strong>aristocrats, which is to say, people who want to spend real time, real money and real effort doing really dumb and unnecessary things &#8212; like learning Japanese &#8212; for the heck of it</strong>. Because make no mistake, there is no socially redeeming value in mountaineering; no one&#8217;s finding a cure for a cancer up there; it&#8217;s cold and squalid and painful and hard to breathe and you might even die.</p>
<p>So, should people stop climbing mountains? Absolutely not. Mountaineering is play for grown-ups, and play doesn&#8217;t need to justify itself. Preventing stupidity (that doesn&#8217;t harm others) is stupid; every society that has done it has stagnated. <a href="http://is.gd/mrJOid">That&#8217;s why this sensible book is one of the dumbest and most dangerous ever written.</a> Hubris drives progress. Chutzpah drives progress. Arrogance and stupidity, real and apparent, drive progress &#8212; and the best part is, if you want, you can sit back and reaps all the benefits without taking any of the risks: it&#8217;s an investor&#8217;s wet dream. No frostbite or edema for you.</p>
<p>As Abraham Flexner pointed out in his essay (monograph?), <em>The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge,</em> useless now becomes useful later, in totally unforeseen ways. Call it serendipity, call it <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb">epistemic blindness</a>, call it what you like, but almost none of the tools and knowledge we now collectively have, use and/or value today would be here if they&#8217;d have had to prove themselves &#8220;useful&#8221; from the get-go.</p>
<p>They just wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Invisible waves, concentric patterns made by iron filings, and kites in rainstorms were not useful. Instead of figuring out how to suck dirt, that Hoover guy or gal should have rolled up his sleeves and used a broom like a <em>normal</em> person. I remember when cellphones started to appear on TV more and more; the non-geeks in my life couldn&#8217;t see the &#8220;use&#8221;; I couldn&#8217;t see the &#8220;use&#8221; either, I just thought they were cool. But who&#8217;s addicted to their cellphones now? Much more non-geeks than geeks. Geeks make the Face Book and the Twitters, non-geeks get hooked on them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The philosophies of one age have become the absurdities of the next, and the foolishness of yesterday has become the wisdom of tomorrow.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/w/williamosl393275.html">William Osler</a></p></blockquote>
<p>What use is sending electronic messages through computer networks? That&#8217;s gay and geeky! Letters work just fine! What use is inventing a writing system and writing s##t down? Just memorize it &#8212; like a <em>real</em> man! What use is a horseless carriage?! They all just break down anyhow! Why do you need a compass?! You should have a sense of direction already!</p>
<p>The aristocratic mindset focuses too much on eternity. The working class mindset focuses too much on immediate utility. Alone, both are useless. Together they are powerful. And you can have them together in your own mind. You kinda need to, because other people can&#8217;t think, pee or learn languages for you.</p>
<p>In history, we talk way too much about wars; I think wars are a stupid and overly bellicose way to analyze history, let alone live life. Perhaps I&#8217;m bellicose about bellicosity. Whatever, anyway. We talk about Caesar as if he personally conquered Gaul. He did nothing of the such. He was <em>never</em> out there sweating and raping and murdering and enslaving Celtic villagers: he had people &#8212; builders, destroyers &#8212; doing that for him; he was sitting in a command tent getting massages from a rentboy and sipping Mimosas while moving Lego pieces around on a parchment map; he gave the vision, they gave the muscle, the legwork. He gave dogma (?), they gave pragma.</p>
<p>So where am I going with this? As usual, I&#8217;ve spread myself too thin, tried to sound too clever, made too many socially disturbing assertions and backed them up too little. Yet the show must go on. So here goes. The only difference between war and murder is direction &#8212; spin. <strong>The only difference between living your life and learning Japanese is direction &#8212; spin.</strong> In war, you basically murder people. In learning Japanese, you basically live your life; you really do. Just with Japanese artifacts and objects instead of English-language ones.</p>
<p>But <strong>if you don&#8217;t fire up that inner aristocrat, you&#8217;re gonna be just a builder, living the default life you were given, in the default language and country you were given, and all within a twenty-five-mile radius of where you were born.</strong> Quaint? Yes. Romantic? Maybe. Interesting? Meh.</p>
<p>Let your inner aristocrat pronounce a bold, mad, stupid vision: &#8220;I am Japanese&#8221;, and then let your inner Sherpas set up immersion camps all the way up to the top &#8212; Japanese speakers in this room, iPod loaded in that room, subscriptions to Japanese premium cable, IMX in your email, whatever it takes.</p>
<p>And then walk on up and be a hero. Just remember to thank your Sherpas, and know that it&#8217;s them that did the work; you weren&#8217;t talented; you weren&#8217;t brave; you weren&#8217;t even competent; you certainly weren&#8217;t hard-working; you were just crazy and fun to be with. And together &#8212; not alone, but together &#8212; you and Tenzing climbed Everest.</p>
<p>Alexander the Great? Wouldn&#8217;ta been so great on his own. He and his people were <em>both</em> essential to the project of&#8230;random and unprecedented Hellenic imperium. Jordan and Pippen both needed each other &#8211; together, they ruled basketball; alone, they were two guys who used to rule basketball. <strong>You need both sides of yourself, the mad side to dream of towers and mansions, and the practical side to lay Lego bricks of fluency one at a time until they stack up high enough.</strong></p>
<p>Now, this kind of thing should go without saying. But it doesn&#8217;t, so I will. Say it, that is. I am not a fan of hereditary ruling elites&#8230;or of ruling elites, period. In no small part because what you get with hereditary ruling elites is stagnant societies ruled by ugly, in-bred people who had one or two Good Guy Greg ancestors (case in point: the Medici ruling family of Florence&#8230;look at the first ones and then look at what they turned into <a class="simple-footnote" title="And let&#8217;s not even go into how Florence&#8217;s rejection of its once-flourishing meritocracy killed innovation and vitality along with social mobility. For a time, Florence was easily the greatest city in Europe. Now, it&#8217;s a tourist attraction at most. Literally, a shell of its former self. Then again, I&#8217;m totally biased. If you or I had reached the absolute top of the heap, the temptation to kick away the ladder would be fierce. I am under no illusions as to what I would do: I would prevent social mobility in order to &#8220;protect&#8221; myself, and I would tell myself that my progeny would rule just fine because I would raise them to rule &#8212; it&#8217;s a lie, but I&#8217;d believe it because believing it would be far too convenient to pass up. On the bright side, maybe Florence is a good enough reverse object lesson; maybe humanity learns from its collective mistakes, despite the many slip-ups along the way. Otherwise-perceptive men like Marcus Aurelius were disastrously unable to see past blood, but we have one massive advantage that Marcus Aurelius did not: we have the example of his mistake in choosing Commodus; we know how that turned out." id="return-note-29640-1" href="#note-29640-1"><sup>1</sup></a>). Ultimately, all you get is decay and decadence because the entire society runs on pure, unadulterated nepotism. The rulers are out of touch with reality and the ruled stopped having abstract thoughts around puberty. You don&#8217;t want that. Nobody but the delusionally nostalgic (<em>ahem</em> <em>cough</em> Alain de Botton <em>cough clearthroat</em>) want to live in that world. But you can take the good from both sides and make something that doesn&#8217;t suck. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m saying.</p>
<p>Disclaimers aside, back to our regular programming.</p>
<p>Aristocratic questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What&#8217;s fun?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s elegant?</li>
<li>What can I do forever?</li>
</ul>
<p>Bob the Builder questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What can I do right now?</li>
<li>What can I do for the next month?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s useful right here and now?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask both types.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no doubt about it. Living to amuse yourself is lonely and pathetic.</p>
<p>But so is living to impress the Joneses. That lifestyle leaves you feeling plenty empty inside; it&#8217;s always psychologically impoverishing and often monetarily so as well. One either dies trying to fill one&#8217;s life with the accoutrements of Jonesiness (BTW, I have IRL friends who are Joneses and they&#8217;re the nicest people in the world), or &#8220;succeeds&#8221; in doing so only to realize that, well, one has won gold at the Idiot Olympics.</p>
<p>It can be sobering to realize that everything you own will eventually end up as trash, burned or buried &#8212; even your own body. Are not cemeteries merely human landfills? Not to mention the whole &#8220;the Sun will turn red giant and burn the Earth to a crisp&#8221; story. And so you are literally buying trash and competing over trash. Living in urban Japan forces these kinds of realizations to hit you early and continually &#8211; since living spaces are so small, you&#8217;re either an episode of <em>Hoarders</em> or you&#8217;re constantly throwing &#8220;perfectly good&#8221; things away; at first it feels bad, but then it feels good.</p>
<p>If hypocrisy were blood sugar, I would be dead and my body would taste sweet. Whether by constitution or conditioning, I&#8217;ve been competitive &#8212; stupidly, pettily so &#8212; from an early age. I&#8217;m afraid of literally everything except cats and leashed dogs, so I like to live in low places &#8212; low floors in hotels and apartment buildings; I like being able to just up and leave the building without recourse to an elevator; I like it where my cats can safely jump out a window. Yet, whenever I board an elevator, and someone else pushes a higher-floor button than me, I feel like <em>less</em> of a person.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty effing petty. And it doesn&#8217;t take a Zen monk with forty years of experience in the meditation industry to realize how dumb this all is. Anyone living in an apartment building or a hotel is a pawn; the real baller is the owner of a building. So comparing penis size or (as the case may be) floor height is like being two medieval soldiers having an arm wrestling competition: you&#8217;re still a pawn in a chess game being played by the king; he&#8217;s gonna wind you up with some BS speech about the feast of Saint Crispin; you&#8217;re gonna fight for him and lose your life or a limb and/or get multiple infections, oh, and, after this is all over, the king will be boinking some erstwhile enemy French princess who smells of peaches and Camembert cheese. But, yeah, nice job with the arm wrestling, maybe some toothless bar wench with armpit lice will smile at you.</p>
<blockquote><p>「I like living. I have sometimes been wildly, despairingly, acutely miserable, racked with sorrow; but through it all I still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing.」<br />
─ Agatha Christie</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of the deeper-thinking personal development people will tell you that the only reason we do anything is because we think it&#8217;ll make us feel good. So, ultimately, it&#8217;s all about experiencing a certain set of pleasant emotional states, particularly that of you liking yourself. It&#8217;s a compelling idea.</p>
<p>And if it is indeed correct, then you&#8217;re likely to find that living to amuse yourself is not only easier (and thus smarter) but also funner. The only reason we even do &#8220;hard&#8221; things is if and because they (are said to) make life easier overall. Human beings always choose (what they perceive to be) the easy route. Even people who join cults that make them suffer physically, do so to be relieved of the intellectual burden of <del>realizing that the AJATT cult is the only true cult I mean</del> thinking for themselves.</p>
<p>What does any of this pseudo-profound<em> ersatz</em> philosophy have to do with getting used to languages?</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s plenty of intellectual jockery associated with language learning, and it&#8217;s just as dumb as regular, physical jockery. It&#8217;s just as meaningless. Language learning is perhaps the only field in my life where I&#8217;ve largely set myself free from competition, and that allows me to take risks and run experiments, which leads to even more progress and, dare I say it, success.</p>
<p>Stephen Covey famously wrote and spoke about the private victory that precedes the public victory. I have found that, in modern life, where we live (for better or worse, often for better) quite separated from other people, for language skill to be created and maintained, the bedroom matters more than the classroom: the things you do in your bedroom, the books you read there, the TV you watch there, the languages you use there, that&#8217;s your real life, that&#8217;s your own private world. It&#8217;s when this world becomes filled with, say, Japanese, that you&#8217;ll see outer manifestations of fluency.</p>
<p>But that almost won&#8217;t matter, because it&#8217;s all for and about you anyway. You don&#8217;t even care that you won the marathon, you were just having a fun jaunt &#8212; very Forrest Gumpy. I kid you not, you may literally not notice. Strangers come and go. Even family can become impermanent if you move around a lot. But you&#8217;ll be there. Impress yourself. Amuse yourself. Entertain yourself. Quantify yourself. Record yourself. Compete with yourself.</p>
<p>Or not. I dunno. Maybe I&#8217;m just lame and antisocial  and trying to justify it <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>
<p>PS: I used &#8220;aspy&#8221; as an adjective rather than a noun. Prolly also misspelled it. Oh, the horror <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe this one should be called &#8220;why life is so good to you, but you don&#8217;t realize it&#8221;.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/dont-start-clean-start-dirty-why-a-clean-slate-is-bad-for-you-and-what-to-do-about-it">Starting dirty is amazing.</a></p>
<p>Remember how video games were back in the 1970s, 1980s and even the first part of the 1990s? No? Well, let me jog your memory: you couldn&#8217;t save!</p>
<p>YA COULDN&#8217;T SAVE! You couldn&#8217;t save your place. So if you messed up, you were back at square one, as if nothing had happened. And you had to do it all in one sitting &#8212; you couldn&#8217;t take a rest. Maybe you could leave your console on, but even if your mother was cool with you doing things that were &#8220;bad for the TV&#8221;, she would inevitably come around with the vacuum cleaner and inadvertently yank the power cord out of the outlet.</p>
<p>Have you ever wished you could go back in time and do it all over again, knowing what you know now?</p>
<p>Well, stop doing that.</p>
<p>Because that&#8217;s what it would be like. It would be like first gen Mario. Yeah, you&#8217;d have all your wisdom from your previous tries, but you&#8217;d also be living the plot of <em>Groundhog Day</em>.</p>
<p>Now, as usual, there are <em>massive </em>logical holes in my reasoning here; I&#8217;ve never been accused of constructing airtight arguments. For one thing, what you want is not the ability to go start totally clean, but the ability to go back to a savepoint.</p>
<p>Well, life kind of gives you that already. You can&#8217;t quite restart from a savepoint, but you can start anew today &#8212; every day is New Year&#8217;s. Every second presents you with new choices &#8212; with new opportunity to make new choices. And, you get to keep all the wisdom and XP you&#8217;ve gained so far.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t restart your Japanese learning from scratch. Don&#8217;t decapitate yourself just because you have a zit. Don&#8217;t burn down the library to fix a typo. Start with everything you have now. Start proud and dirty.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&#8217;s the point of even trying? What&#8217;s the point of even showing up? What&#8217;s the point of starting or continuing anything when other people are so much better at it than you? What&#8217;s the point of doing anything you&#8217;re not already and instantly the best in the world at? Why endure the shame, the laughter, the mockery, the derision, the doubts, the loneliness, the slips and falls, the embarrassment, the never-ending loss of dignity?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point of even going to space if you&#8217;re not going to out-Armstrong Neil Armstrong? What&#8217;s the point of having money if other people are just going to have more if it than you? What&#8217;s the point of having a TV if it isn&#8217;t the biggest in the neighborhood &#8212; in the world? What&#8217;s the point of having a house if it isn&#8217;t the swankiest house in the history of houses? What&#8217;s the point of having nice things that no one else can see, let alone realizes are nice?</p>
<p>Are you even worthy? Do you even deserve to learn a language? Aren&#8217;t you just clogging up the pipes of the world with your suckiness? Wouldn&#8217;t it be better if you just grew up, grew a pair and stopped trying and took your dignity home with you?</p>
<p>Like, better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt, right? At least if you never try, you have infinite possibilities, because nobody in the world knows what you could have become if you <em>had</em> tried.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s unpack this.<br />
↑ My new favorite catchphrase.</p>
<p>They own at it. But they don&#8217;t own it. Not exclusively.</p>
<p>You are not better than Usain Bolt.<br />
And he is not better than you.</p>
<p>He is better &#8212; faster &#8212; at training for and thus running one hundred meter races (and not even twice as fast, just a couple seconds faster) than you are. But that doesn&#8217;t matter because:<br />
1) He <em>totally</em> isn&#8217;t competing against you: let me assure you of that. You&#8217;re not even in his league, and<br />
2) He&#8217;s totally not in your league either. He never could and never will make it into your league. Because you and previous versions of you are the only people in your league. You aren&#8217;t competing against him and he&#8217;s not competing against you. He breaks his own personal bests (world records), and so should you. You&#8217;re competing against yourself, against your beginner self, against previous versions of yourself, against future (yes, future) versions of yourself. We all run alone. We&#8217;re all in this alone together.</p>
<p>You and Mr. Bolt both have a right to run.<br />
Leonard Susskind doesn&#8217;t own theoretical physics just because he&#8217;s doing so much more of it (and so much better) than you.<br />
The textbook writers don&#8217;t own the subject.<br />
The top pro leagues don&#8217;t own the sport.<br />
The JLPT people don&#8217;t own Japanese just because they know more of it than you.</p>
<p>And you don&#8217;t own it either. We&#8217;re all tenants, and we all get just about one vote in the association.<br />
The penthouse tenant doesn&#8217;t own the building: he&#8217;s just in its most widely desired unit.<br />
One day, maybe you&#8217;ll be living in it.<br />
Or maybe you&#8217;ll take the easy, cunning choice and make up your own game &#8212; cup-stacking, beersbee and ballroom dancing are all sports &#8212; and you can be its penthouse tenant. Maybe you&#8217;ll invent the ten meter race, just to prove a point <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not worthy&#8221;, they say.</p>
<p>Of course you&#8217;re worthy, you stupid turd. You may suck (for now), you may suck forever, but you&#8217;re always worthy.</p>
<p>The only reason you even care about other people is because you spend far too much time thinking of and about them, and far too little time thinking of and about yourself. You know their names, their big dates, their famous numbers and stats, but you barely know any of your own. You don&#8217;t even bother collecting your own stats properly; you don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re worth collecting &#8212; and that&#8217;s a strange thought coming from a totally unique, irreplaceable, induplicable person.</p>
<p>If you did actually bother to run your own stats, you&#8217;d start to notice that all cumulative stats only ever increase (or flatline). Your total number of goals scored can only ever go up. And that alone is encouraging enough to keep you playing forever.</p>
<p>You know how, like, there can be a chick&#8230;sorry, a sheila &#8212; who&#8217;s been your friend forever and never even registered on your radar, but one day you suddenly start thinking she&#8217;s cute?</p>
<p>You are that chick. And you&#8217;ve never bothered to notice yourself. You&#8217;ve never bothered to take an interest in yourself. You&#8217;re just the chick next door. You&#8217;re just the guy who lives across the hallway, with whom you share an awkward-but-comforting familiarity&#8230;sometimes you say &#8220;hi&#8221; to each other when picking up the mail, but try to avoid eye contact because you can&#8217;t think of what to say for smalltalk this is not autobiographical by the way <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  . You&#8217;re just the inhabitant of your body.</p>
<p>So, back to our original question:<br />
What&#8217;s the point?<br />
What&#8217;s the point of it all? What&#8217;s the point of any of it?</p>
<p>There is no point. But it might be fun&#8230;if you let it be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I get all kinds of emails from breathless kids wanting me to tell them exactly how to do it &#8212; how to get used to a language. And they want it all, they want to know every single detail. They&#8217;ve never made an MCD in their life, but they want to know right now, in advance, exactly whether what they&#8217;re doing is right and whether or not it&#8217;s going to work.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that kind of conscientiousness&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;Except for its timing.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s pretend that you&#8217;re cheap with your money but loose with your time (read: a college student lol) so you&#8217;ve decided to take a road trip from Nueva York to Los Angels. Do you really need to know every twist and turn? Do you really need a list of every single turn and every single road between Russ &amp; Daughters on Houston Street and the BookOff in Torrance?</p>
<p>No. <strong>All you actually need to know is the <em>next</em> step, the <em>next</em> turn.</strong> And when you get there, you can check again to make sure you&#8217;re going in the right direction, ask around (the map is not the territory &#8212; things go out of date quite rapidly; roads are under repair sometimes). If you&#8217;re a beginner (whether a total beginner or a beginner in a new phase), the first step is the next step, so all you need to know is the first step.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t even need to know whether or not what you&#8217;re doing is gonna work. In most cases, your problem is not bad action but total inaction.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to listen to me that hard in the beginning. You just need to get started. When to really listen to me is in the middle, when I tell you you&#8217;re not hearing enough Japanese or you need to start buying Japanese books long before you can even understand them, or&#8230;whatever.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in the MIDDLE that you need my advice. It&#8217;s your mid-game that needs work. It&#8217;s your mid-game that needs my help most, not your opening game. Even the worst methods in the world (read: school) can get people to so-called &#8220;intermediate&#8221; level &#8212; middling proficiency where you know quite a bit but you also start to realize (and let yourself become oppressed by) the magnitude of what you <em>don&#8217;t</em> know.</p>
<p>But it takes an AntiMoon, an AJATT-like method to take you from middling intermediate to advanced and native-like awesomeness.</p>
<p>Now, here is where life starts to imitate Greek tragedy: even though mid-game is where people need my advice most, it is also when they are least likely to take it. Cassandra becomes my middle name. By mid-game, you&#8217;ve got rhythm and habits and prejudices, good and bad. You&#8217;ve got firm beliefs. It really is ironic, because in the beginning, people are so open to instruction, so bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, so virgin snow-like that they even suspend their belief in common sense. Example:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it OK if I watch movies in Japanese, Khatz?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Is rap music OK to listen to, Khatz?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Is it OK if I watch American movies dubbed into Japanese, Khatz? Won&#8217;t I pick up bad dub habits?&#8221;</p>
<p>To me, these questions defy belief. If I sit back calmly, sip some organic milk, and have just had a professional massage, then I&#8217;ve got enough control over my anger reflex to not just lash out with a flippant remark, and I can momentarily see how a person could be asking me questions like those. Incidentally, the answer to all of those questions is simple:</p>
<p>Do Japanese kids do it?<br />
Then 999,999 out of a million times, it&#8217;ll be good for you to do, too.</p>
<p>But, yeah, Cassandra syndrome, because by mid-game, not only do unorthodox methods get rejected, so does common sense. Beginners often refuse to think for themselves while intermediates refuse any ideas that defy those they accepted as beginners.</p>
<p>This Greek tragedy business is both globally and locally true. So you even see it on small scales. Guy who&#8217;s decided to make MCDs has five million questions for me. But once he&#8217;s made some, my small-but-significant corrections and suggestions fall on deaf ears. He goes from&#8230;I dunno&#8230;something to something else. How to not be that guy? Make some MCDs first&#8230;try stuff for a few weeks first, and then show me what you&#8217;ve tried and ask me about it.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Opening game is a quantity problem, not a quality problem. Get Japanese in your ears. Get Japanese in your eyes. Get kanji coming out of your hand. It&#8217;s all about volume. It&#8217;s mid-game where clever tweaks start to carry more weight. It&#8217;s mid-game where I want you to hang on my every word (not literally, but&#8230;yeah).</p>
<p>Mid-game is when I want you to be open to suggestions and corrections, because at mid-game, I&#8217;m making suggestions and corrections based on actual data &#8212; experiential data that you have been so kind as to accumulate for me, yourself and the world.</p>
<p>And, at every stage, obviously assuming no bodily harm, I want you to <strong>try first and ask questions later</strong>. Try things out before talking back. Talk back all you want once you&#8217;ve actually given something a try. So, guy who dismisses SRS out of hand? Idiot. Guy who tries SRS, uses it correctly (in short, frequent bursts, not binges) and still wants out? Smart guy; let him walk his own path.</p>
<p>Head in the general direction of LA first, and<strong> ask for directions not once in one big advice binge, but many times along the way. </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether it&#8217;s a book, a newspaper, or just a tablet computer, I almost always have Chinese literature in hand with me.</p>
<p>And when you do that, you get to meet people who are convinced that they could never become literate.</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t even have to go that far and actually interact with people. To find the most potent source of defeatist opinionation, you need only look inside yourself and the affective states &#8212; emotions &#8212; you create for yourself whenever you come across a word or words you don&#8217;t (yet) know, can&#8217;t (yet) read or can&#8217;t (yet) understand.</p>
<p>Your ignorance. You hate it. Even though your ignorance is actually your friend &#8212; ignorance means there&#8217;s more for you to do. Without ignorance, there would be no novelty, no surprises, no discovery, because you&#8217;d know everything already. Movies and jokes where you know what&#8217;s going to happen are called &#8220;predictable&#8221;, &#8220;trite&#8221; and &#8220;cliched&#8221;. Why? Because you have no <em>ignorance</em>! When someone takes away your ignorance of a movie it&#8217;s called a &#8220;spoiler&#8221;; they&#8217;ve spoiled it &#8212; like rotten food. Ignorance makes the world interesting. Ignorance makes life worth living.</p>
<p>Ignorance is not your enemy. Ignorance is your friend. Your reaction to your own ignorance &#8212; that despair, that self-loathing, and the screw-it-all helplessness they cause &#8212; that&#8217;s your enemy.</p>
<p>The trick to overcoming your ignorance is not to sit around hating yourself. Don&#8217;t hate yourself in general. Free-floating hate is unproductive. Get specific about your hate, get specific about your ignorance. Don&#8217;t hate wo/men, hate that one wo/man. Don&#8217;t hate Japanese people, hate that one guy at the counter &#8212; find out his full name so you can use it as a curse word. Hate is not your problem, sloppiness is your problem, imprecision is your problem.</p>
<p>Hate with precision. Don&#8217;t spread it around. Be stingy. Hate with pinpoint temporal-spatial specificity. <strong>Find a specific quantum of ignorance and erase it and it alone.</strong> Then move on to another quantum. Yeah, there are a lot of words you don&#8217;t know, but you&#8217;ve got to work with <em>one</em> specific word that you don&#8217;t know, <em>not </em>with the fact that &#8220;there are (so) many things I don&#8217;t know&#8221;. That&#8217;s not a useful fact; it&#8217;s not an actionable unit; it&#8217;s not any kind of unit; it&#8217;s just a vague, depressing factoid.</p>
<p>Find a specific quantum of solace I mean ignorance and erase it and it alone. Repeat enough times and you won&#8217;t be ignorant any more. I mean, not cosmically, of course, but in relative terms, you will turn into well-informed awesome sauce. Socially, you may easily become one of the best in the world in your chosen field.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not exaggerating. You seriously will become one of the best, like no one ever was, if only because most people give up without ever even trying. And now you&#8217;re like &#8220;but I done tried already, Khatz, and it didn&#8217;t work&#8221;. Well, try again. There&#8217;s no shame in having to try multiple times. I had to go through RTK multiple times myself, and I kept stumbling and restarting and feeling like a schmuck; it was only Chris Houser and SuperMemo that helped me get through it. Now I&#8217;m literate and people think I&#8217;m smart. I&#8217;m not smart; <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-search-for-the-system-how-i-found-one-why-you-need-one">I&#8217;m systematic &#8212; I use systems, recipes. Not intelligence, not brute force. Systems.</a></p>
<p>Like an employee at McDonald&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t need to be a good cook to make it work; I just <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/popping-bubblewrap-tips-for-better-srs-sentence-items">run through the sequences in the manual, like popping bubblewrap</a>. It&#8217;s like <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-accomplish-great-things-small-victories-winnable-games">when I did janitorial work &#8212; that job was so systematized that a borderline OCD person (me, back then) could come in, get to work, get it right and get it done <em>despite themselves</em></a>. With AJATT, you can go one further: don&#8217;t use learning methods that work despite your faults: use methods that work <em>because</em> of your faults; every bad habit you have can be put to good use.</p>
<p>So&#8230;yeah&#8230;that&#8217;s that story.</p>
<p>Anyway, again, never &#8212; <em>not ever</em> &#8211; deal with the entirety of your ignorance, neither physically (because it&#8217;s impossible) and nor emotionally (because it&#8217;s dangerously counterproductive). Do not acknowledge it, pay it no notice. Focus on one quantum at a time. Digital ignorance (I am ignorant of just this 1 thing), analog knowledge (I&#8217;m pretty awesome all around).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Said Aaron Casey:</p>
<blockquote><p>Please help me, Khatzumoto. You are my only hope.</p>
<p>So, I am emailing you on this fine day&#8230;to ask you what your views on scheduling are. And what I mean by that is setting aside specific time for learning.</p>
<p>On just about every other Japanese learning website I have been to, and even just general learning websites, they all say I should create a schedule of specific times to learn things. Example:</p>
<ol>
<li>At 10am do anki reviews for an hour.</li>
<li>Then at 11am study kanji for an hour.</li>
<li>Afterwards, read generic Japanese textbook for 2 hours.</li>
<li>Then, at 1pm, do other assorted crap, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>And for most people, that would be fine. But I am the type who has lived my entire life unscheduled. I really enjoy being spontaneous and coming up with things on the go. I do not like living my life by a schedule.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>But, as I said, a lot of educators say: &#8220;you must schedule your time or you will fail and Tkyosam will sacrifice your children to the Church of Scientology.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Okay, maybe they don&#8217;t say that last part but you get the gist. So, I want to know if you think there are actually any benefits to scheduling your learning time versus just going with the flow.<br />
Also, just to give you an idea of what I have been doing: I work part-time; I am studying computer science, and I am studying Japanese. So far, I have just kind of given each of my studies their own time whenever I feel it is suitable, but I don&#8217;t know if I should be creating specific schedules for each or not.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s unpack this.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am the type who has lived my entire life unscheduled.</p></blockquote>
<p>As am I. I&#8217;ve tried scheduling, but it works as well as when gay people try to go straight.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>[Do] you think there are actually any benefits to scheduling your learning time versus just going with the flow[?]</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not a question of which way is objectively (or even subjectively) better. It&#8217;s a question of what you&#8217;re actually going to do and keep doing. You, like me, seem constitutionally unsuited to scheduling. So don&#8217;t bother. I didn&#8217;t. You haven&#8217;t liked scheduling in other contexts, it hasn&#8217;t helped you; you didn&#8217;t learn English on a schedule. Why is Japanese going to be magically different? Your personality is not going to change and you&#8217;re not going to become a better person.</p>
<p>So screw it. Your choices are certainly affected by the environment, but they can also transcend it. The trick to this transcendence is <i>not </i>more morality. Do not become a better person. The trick is to make choices that change the environment itself &#8212; no morality required. Plus longer-lasting.</p>
</div>
<div><strong><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/immersion-why-you-should-stop-trying-to-control-or-measure-time">I didn&#8217;t control time, I controlled <i>space </i>instead. </a>The content of my space was all Japanese. </strong>Time is a slippery bastard; space is much more tractable and stable. Control your space &#8212; your environment &#8212; time will take care of itself. And this is why, for the longest time, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-do-immersion-a-day-in-the-life-of-khatzumoto">I was so vehemently opposed to giving a time-based account</a> of &#8220;<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/a-day-in-the-life-of-khatzumoto-no-for-real">a day in the life of Khatzumoto</a>&#8220;, because I wasn&#8217;t running on time, I was running on space and mindset.</div>
<p>You don&#8217;t speak a language, you use it.<br />
You don&#8217;t learn a language, you live it.</p>
<p>You are always using &#8212; and therefore learning &#8212; a language. The only question is which one.</p>
<p>Do you schedule breathing time?</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Then why schedule language time?</p>
<p>The only &#8220;hook&#8221; or &#8220;anchor&#8221; I would use for language exposure is eating time and sleeping time. Make sure you&#8217;re in contact with your L2:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whenever you&#8217;re eating &#8212; throughout your meal times</li>
<li>Whenever you&#8217;re sleeping &#8212; in and around (right before and right after) your sleep time, and</li>
<li>Whenever you&#8217;re on the pot &#8212; because that&#8217;s where some of your best reading and thinking gets done&#8230;right now, I actually have two mobile devices &#8212; an old iPod Touch and an old iPhone (one always charging, one always loose) &#8211; that permanently live in my bathroom area, just for doing SRS reps.</li>
</ol>
<p>But that&#8217;s not really &#8220;scheduling&#8221;; it&#8217;s &#8220;anchoring&#8221;. You don&#8217;t get good at language, you get used to it. It&#8217;s about habitual exposure &#8212; habits. <strong>You need Japanese habits, not scheduling habits</strong>. The best way to get Japanese habits is to anchor onto the habits you already have, not to try to form new habits.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: If you love scheduling and it actually works for you, then knock yourself out. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/potheads-planners-and-players">My experience is that most people who use scheduling suck at it, suck at making themselves happy and &#8212; most ironically of all &#8212; suck at getting things done; they&#8217;re great at making plans and crap at following through</a>. But my experience is limited, and there are exceptions to everything.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stop trying to control and measure time.</p>
<p>Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I still love (and use) timeboxing. But that&#8217;s almost more about controlling the self and forcing out perfectionism than it is about controlling time; time is, in the context of timeboxing, the perfect cross-platform tool for managing the situation.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s why you should stop trying to control and measure time, especially in long-term, open-ended, immersion contexts.</p>
<p>Because space is easier.</p>
<p>Way easier.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s much easier to control space than to control time.<br />
Another name for local space is &#8220;environment&#8221;.</p>
<p>Control your space. Control what sounds (spoken language) and images (written script) are allowed to predominate in the physical and semi-physical (virtual/software) spaces of your life.</p>
<p><strong>Control your space and you shall automatically control your time.</strong></p>
<p>Because screw counting immersion hours. That&#8217;s way too much trouble right now. Maybe technology will change that. But as Juba in &#8220;Gladiator&#8221; said: not yet&#8230;not yet.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggernaut_(Marvel_Comics)"><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/Juggernaut2.PNG" width="300" height="365" /></a>One is reminded of Juggernaut from <a href="http://is.gd/sJenxu">X-Men 3: The Last Stand</a>.</p>
<p>For a fan of the X-Men comics, the movie version of JG was too small, but that&#8217;s beside the point.</p>
<p>Juggernaut is an unstoppable force. And if time is real, and if time is like Juggernaut &#8212; unstoppable, inexorable in its passage, then perhaps we can hitch a ride on it by &#8212; no, wait, that just makes time seem scary.</p>
<p>No, um&#8230;I dunno. Whatever.</p>
<p>Anyway!</p>
<p>We can be like Juggernaut (what would Juggernaut do?). We become like Juggernaut when we do one active thing at a time. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/what-would-happen-if-you-went-mad-like-sparta-and-started-immersing-like-a-time-vampire-killing-terminator-robot"><strong>Many passive things</strong> &#8212; background immersion counts and works</a> &#8212; <strong>but <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/timeboxing-trilogy-part-1-what-and-why">only ever one active thing</a></strong>. When we calm down, we become powerful. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/gloaf-give-less-of-a-fucare">About which a fark can be given only one thing (or less) at a time can there be.</a></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve never seen someone screaming and shouting and thought: &#8220;what a powerful guy!&#8221;, have you? Losing your head doesn&#8217;t make you powerful, it doesn&#8217;t make you concerned, it doesn&#8217;t make you loving and sincere, it just makes you, well, lost. Incoherent. Energy dispersed and full of crap, like an overflowing toilet. Lacking in the laser-like focus of a magnifying glass, lacking in the narrow, purposeful direction of water in a properly flushing toilet.</p>
<p>A lot of toilet talk today.</p>
<p>Now, take a look at yourself. Do you wanna be powerful? Then <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/calm-down-and-hurry-up">calm down</a>. Read <a href="http://is.gd/maw6Qf">Eckhart Tolle if you must. No, really.</a> His <em>Practicing the Power of Now</em> is one of the most, well, practical books on concentration ever written, and it came right out of the fruity, New Age fringe you so love to hate <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  . It would be bigoted to ignore the things he&#8217;s right about just because you disagree with the things he&#8217;s wrong about&#8230;like not hanging out with a kid because he&#8217;s Greek Orthodox and you&#8217;re Catholic (the correct answer, by the way, is Mormonism). If you&#8217;re old enough to read this, you&#8217;re old enough to pick the bones out of your own books; you shouldn&#8217;t need everything dumbed down and turned into inoffensive, easy-to-chew, easy-to-swallow fillet just so you can &#8220;safely&#8221; consume it; that&#8217;s for babies. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Disclaimer: I eat all my fish boneless because&#8230;I&#8217;m both a wimp and a hypocrite." id="return-note-28945-1" href="#note-28945-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
<p>Relax.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p><strong>One new word a time.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying this because I&#8217;m wise or smart or deep. I am none of those things. But this works. Calming down works. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m sharing this with you.</p>
<p>Of course you can be calm when there&#8217;s nothing to worry about, no readily available ingredients for your worry casserole, but that&#8217;s like saying: &#8220;this building always has running water <em>except</em> when there&#8217;s a fire&#8221;, or &#8220;this room has electric lights running at all times except when it&#8217;s dark outside). It is precisely <em>because</em> everyone else is afraid and in a panic, it is precisely <em>because</em> there are things for you to worry about that you must be clam, I mean, calm <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>
<p>You must be clam!</p>
<p>Haha.</p>
<p>It is precisely <em>because</em> there&#8217;s a fire raging that you must be the water. It is precisely when everything is at its hottest that you must be at your coolest. Panic and pessimism are the only options you cannot afford. You don&#8217;t have time for that. Water only beats fire by being relentless and oblivious to it, not by also turning into fire. In short, by acting just like the fire doesn&#8217;t act, but being the antithesis of fire. Bruce Lee was talking about glasses and Coco-Cola at the time, but he still said it first: be like water, my friend.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/let-go-but-dont-let-go-the-learning-paradox">Thousands of words to learn. The prospect, tall and daunting like a skyscraper</a> in a <a href="http://is.gd/2R6xnp">1970s disaster movie.</a> And then there&#8217;s little old you. Tiny. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/continual-questioning">Will you ever make it? Stupid question. </a>Just start making it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/make-the-process-fit-the-person">If your process sucks, then your life sucks.</a></p>
<p>And if your life sucks, then (get this&#8230;wait for it&#8230;) your <em><strong>life</strong> </em>sucks.</p>
<p>And no milestone can change that.</p>
<p>No milestone will erase day-to-day suckage.</p>
<p>No peak of achievement will make it taste sweet. Not for more than five minutes. Maybe an hour of afterglow. And if you think about it,<strong> it&#8217;s really awful math&#8230;s&#8230;to spend thousands of hours in pain just so you can bask in five minutes of grudgingly given public glory</strong> (which you can&#8217;t even enjoy properly, because success has a hundred far king fathers, so you&#8217;re supposed to act humble and give credit to all the people who helped you along the way in your masochism）.</p>
<p>Or maybe it will; maybe the peak will make it all worth it; I dunno&#8230;many mothers talk about childbirth as having an amnesiac effect, erasing all the pain that went into it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-have-you-been-killing-babies">But I&#8217;m not a mother and your brainchild isn&#8217;t a human baby, although we&#8217;ve previously discussed how it is a metaphorical one</a>. It&#8217;s just a game. It won&#8217;t make you lactate or forget the pain.</p>
<p>Speaking of games&#8230;I have played PlayStation until my thumbs swelled to (I kid you not) twice their normal size, but I did eventually stop when I got my fill of beating my friend, Ngoc, at the boxing game we were playing. And I didn&#8217;t really take the swelling as a badge of honor, just a funny sign that Ngoc and I had played far too much PlayStation that January morning. And I was having fun the whole time, so it didn&#8217;t hurt; the sight of my hands was somewhat alarming, but not painful. Adrenaline, I guess. Did I mention I beat Ngoc at the game? Yeah. Wonned him. Trounced him. In his own house. Multiple times.</p>
<p>And each time I did it, I danced to the game soundtrack and vaguely humped the air, just to make him angry <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>
<p>So <strong>I&#8217;m not saying don&#8217;t go all out, necessarily. I&#8217;m saying&#8230;don&#8217;t suffer.</strong> Not worth it. You won&#8217;t build character: you&#8217;ll just build a track record of suffering. To top it off, you&#8217;ll build a reputation as a sufferer, and people will come to you to suffer for them. So now, you&#8217;re not just suffering for yourself, you&#8217;re the village suffering bicycle and everybody wants a ride. Kind of like how I rode Ngoc at boxing on that PlayStation. Did I mention that I beat him?</p>
<p><strong>Why suffer for 10,000 hours just so you can enjoy 1, when you could enjoy all 10,000?</strong> I mean, are you seeing the exchange rate here? Are you seeing how bad it is? When you trade time away, you are trading life away. Now, unfortunately, you can&#8217;t hoard your surplus time and not trade it, it keeps very badly, but you could <strong>at least make trades that don&#8217;t suck</strong>. Hint: when you get more suffering than joy on the trade, leading experts consider that a bad trade.</p>
<p>Any time spent learning how to make a long-term learning more fun is time well spent because the stakes are so high. Life itself is at stake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/07/goal-planning-for-optimal-enjoyment/">Instead of just having a goal worth having, have a process worth living.</a> That way you win three times: you win at the beginning; you win at the end and you win all through the middle, which is the biggest part.</p>
<p>You can be winning literally the whole time. <a class="simple-footnote" title="There&#8217;s a Charlie Sheen joke somewhere in there; we leave it as an exercise for the reader." id="return-note-29171-1" href="#note-29171-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
<p>And sometimes, all it takes is a mindset change. Here&#8217;s one: <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/there-is-no-end-what-are-you-going-to-do-about-it">don&#8217;t view learning Chinese as a step toward learning Chinese, but as itself a part of already knowing Chinese</a>. To know Chinese is to learn it, is to be learning it; <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/before-fluency-after-fluency">it is not a state; it&#8217;s a series of dynamic state transitions; it is a process, a way of life</a>. And after all, if you started to neglect the language today, you would start sucking today&#8230;Live it, don&#8217;t &#8220;learn&#8221; it.</p>
