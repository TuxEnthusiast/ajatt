		<description><![CDATA[Today I realized something. Somewhere I read that &quot;the more you hate something, the stronger it becomes&quot;, but it never occurred to me that the more others hate YOU, the more powerful YOU become. 
The more they hate you, the more they can be affected by what you say or do. The more they hate you, the more your successes will hurt them. The more they hate you, the more that they damage themselves.
As Khatz would say: Don&#039;t hate, stop being &quot;an hero&quot;, let haters be hatin&#039;, and let success be the ultimate revenge.]]></description>

Another thing I&#039;ve said many times before: &quot;The average 40 year old is stupider than a child because they&#039;ve had 40 years to develop an ego&quot; People generally get more stupid the older they get; the difference between the average child and the average &#039;adult&#039; is that the adult has had so many years to develop an ego =-p]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is pretty much how I get through everyday working in Customer Service. Because let me tell you... there are some nasty people on the other side of that counter. ;D
 
Also, an on-the-side inspirational story? My great-grandmother was paying for my college, and one day I told her that I was thinking of majoring in Japanese. She immediately went into an &#039;educational&#039; rant as to how they (the Japanese people) are all devils and monsters because they killed her brother in WW1 (... or was it 2? &gt;_&gt; no, probably 1) So, I sat there, and listened to her story to the very end, and when she had nothing left to say, I began to tell her of all the beautiful and amazing things about Japan, and how you can&#039;t blame a whole nation for the actions of a select few people. She still wouldn&#039;t accept it though (old people are stubborn) and every time I would go to see her, she would remind me of how she &quot;disapproved&quot;. Time flows right along though, it doesn&#039;t stop for anyone - and neither does my Japanese. She could have disowned me, stopped paying for my college, thrown rocks at me? ...but that&#039;s still no reason to give up on what I loved. No one was going to die because I wanted to study a foreign language. 
Fast forward to today, she found out how Martha Stewart (her idol) loves Japan, and now she can&#039;t get enough of it. Irony. The same person who cursed those &#039;foul dogs&#039;, now praises them as if it was the most obvious of things in the world. If someone is too ignorant to even listen to your side of the story, they&#039;re not worth explaining it to. Let them realize your genius on their own. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s strange, I haven&#039;t experienced many jerks in my language learning experience... Maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;m not very social, but really, any time someone sees me doing reps, writing kanji, or pulling out my iPod during classroom breaks are like, &quot;What are you doing? Learning Japanese?! Sweet!&quot;
 
Could be that I&#039;m in college... and I also kind of gave up on caring about other people&#039;s perspectives in my final years of high school... 
 
Is this a big issue to a lot of people?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES. 
The people I live around tend to be intimidated by me because I don&#039;t pay them much attention and do things I know is going to get me looks but do them wholeheartedly with disregard to how people will label it. I&#039;ve talked about this subject with my brother recently, and I&#039;ve said a few times &#039;People are not the be-all-and-end-all of everything to the individual. They are not you. A person shouldn&#039;t be bound to any one person.&#039; I also referenced your article that talks about how your friends were upset because you were doing your own thing and not what they want to do - this is why I don&#039;t make &#039;close&#039; friends, because each person is their own person and whatever somebody else does is irrelevant to the individual; so what if so-and-so won&#039;t go out with a drink with you? There&#039;s bazillions of other people in the world, why be bound by any one person? Why be upset that they are doing their thing and not somebody else&#039;s? A true friend, then, is one that embraces a person for what they are and is not bound by them. They accept that they are what they are, and they are what they are.
 
As &#039;sad&#039; as it sounds, for most people &#039;friends&#039; are a burden - because most people are bound to people they label as friends, they become upset when they do what they will and not what others will, and they have to avoid being themselves to stay on friendly terms. Is this not sad? Others are not you. Being acceptive of this fact is really the only thing that could seperate &#039;friends&#039; from any one else - otherwise they&#039;re just another unnecessary burden.
 
In short, if they hate you for it, in that moment they are not your friend - so let them be. Let them hate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This has come along at just the time I need it. I write my notes in work in as much kanji as I can manage, and people give me odd looks and mutter things about me. Even call me &#039;weird&#039; and &#039;strange&#039; to my face.

It seems for too long I&#039;ve actually cared about all of this. If I free them, I free me.

I love you Khatz. \(^o^)/ ]]></description>
