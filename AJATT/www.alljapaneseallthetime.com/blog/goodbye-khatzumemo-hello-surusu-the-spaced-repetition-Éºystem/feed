		<description><![CDATA[@ Bloodhawk,  Thanks.  It&#039;s gonna work out ok, cuz campus has wi-fi (thought it didn&#039;t, but it does now) and home has wi-fi, I&#039;ll just use my laptop!  And for commute time, well, SuRuSu-ing while driving is probably not what Khatz has in mind when he says &quot;complete and total immersion&quot;. (Like how I made that a verb, Khatz?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@khatzmoto-  I can get a flat rate plan, but being a broke college student I wanted to minimize the costs.  I&#039;ll just have to get a better phone plan (and maybe a better phone) when my classes start.  

@bk201- Kats is brilliant, I&#039;m super excited to be using his SRS for my studies.  Just, don&#039;t spread the word around outside the language circle, the program I want into is EXTREMEMLY competitive, I don&#039;t want anyone else around here to have my secret edge! (seriously, I have to make 4.0 and still won&#039;t be guaranteed a seat!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Summer :D
Unfortunately, it is completely web-based, so it needs the Internet connection to function...
Maybe they have a flat-rate plan you can use? If being able to do SRS reps on the move saves you significant amounts of time, then it might well be worth the $$$.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Kats, I remember that you were constantly on your cellphone using the the SRS thing to study.  I&#039;m starting a nursing course (Sort of, first I have to get a 4.0 on the pre-reqs and get into the program) and want to use SRS to study my chem, anatomy, pharmacology etc.  Is that doable without having to pay the ridiculously expensive per minute fees that cell phone companies charge for internet access via the cellphone? Eg. can I download the &quot;cards&quot; that I make on to my phone and use it as an application instead of a website?  I have a 2GB memory card in my cellphone....]]></description>
