		<description><![CDATA[Great post and interesting thoughts. The use of games or game-like abilities when doing &quot;real stuff&quot; is a huge interest of mine. :)

Are you familiar with Jane McGonigal and her &quot;Reality is Broken&quot;? She&#039;s a director at Institute for the Future and is specialised in the usage of games in this way, to become better, more effective or to overcome certain problems. I really recommend the book (I do think you&#039;ll like it, considering the post above :) ).

I wrote a short post about her thoughts here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://better-reality-games.com/the-reality-is-broken-and-how-i-took-mine-to-service-it-is-not-quite-finished-yet/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://better-reality-games.com/the-reality-is-broken-and-how-i-took-mine-to-service-it-is-not-quite-finished-yet/

&lt;/a&gt;And she held a TED lecture about how gaming can make the world a better place: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world.html

		<description><![CDATA[¡Hello!
Thanks a lot for this great article!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It gave me the motivation I needed to re-start doing two of the things I like the most: studying japanese and writing stories. I was forcing me too much and without realizing it I had lost the joy of doing the things I like the most. This article has given me a lot of exciting ideas I will put into practice. I had forgotten the miracles that ocurr when you live your &quot;here&quot; and &quot;now&quot; without caring about anything else. From the bottom of my heart: ¡THANKYOU VERY MUCH! ^_^!]]></description>
