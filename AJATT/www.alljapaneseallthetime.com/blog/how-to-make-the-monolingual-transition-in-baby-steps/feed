		<description><![CDATA[I agree. 

However, the biggest issue I&#039;ve ever had with children&#039;s dictionaries is that I can&#039;t really find one that I can use on my computer to copy/paste from. This means a LOT of manual entries, which are ... time consuming. On the other hand, furigana and having pictures for some things are awesome.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, thanks!  I had picked up a grade school dictionary way back, in anticipation of the monolingual transition, based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-i%E2%80%99m-in-love-with-my-japanese-japanese-dictionary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.  But by the time I actually got around to transitioning I had forgotten all about it! I&#039;d been managing to do OK with dic.yahoo.co.jp, more or less, but this really was a zillion times easier.  And then I tried out the app which was like another factor of a zillion times easier!  While I&#039;ll probably want to head back to adult dictionaries at some point (after 1000 cards, maybe?) for the time being this feels really game-changing.  Thanks again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My two yen worth...

For me, the transition to mono was a zillion times easier by starting out using a J-J dictionary made for grade school children.  Easy definitions, easy sample sentences.  Once I got used to that, I transitioned to a more adult-centric dictionary, but I still frequently go back to the kiddie jisho when needed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alright Khatz, I&#039;ll bite. I&#039;ve quit mono so many times. I just can&#039;t seem to make it stick, I get a little ways in then it starts to become painful and just not worth the time vs just doing regular mono cards but I do recognize the benefit when I read j-j sentences I can already understand I just wish I could make a full SRS transition I don&#039;t know how people do it. I&#039;ll do this though sign me up, because I want to finally get over this hurdle... Where is the link or pricing info or countdown? Unless I&#039;m missing something. I don&#039;t see anything above or in the ajatt store, in the source code, mother&#039;s legs etc.]]></description>
