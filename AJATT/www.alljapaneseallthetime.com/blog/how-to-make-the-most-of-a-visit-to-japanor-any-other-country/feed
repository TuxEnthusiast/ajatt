		<description><![CDATA[Khatzumoto,

I&#039;ve been reading this blog for a few weeks and have borrowed a ton from your approach for my Mandarin studies. I&#039;ve linked your blog on mine and wanted to make sure it was ok with you. Please keep it up, your blog is as fun to read as it is informative and helpful. Just wanted to pop in and say thanks.
