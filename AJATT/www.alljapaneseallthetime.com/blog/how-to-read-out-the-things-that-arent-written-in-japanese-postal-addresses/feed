		<description><![CDATA[Precisely speaking, the explanation of &quot;番地&quot; and &quot;番&quot; above is not correct.
Please take a look at the following explanation:
http://www.city.matsuyama.ehime.jp/FAQ/Anser/FAQ11977.html

Every lot in a residential area has a &quot;番地&quot; which is the number to uniquely identify the piece of land.
And only when the area is subject to &quot;住居表示&quot; , as defined in &quot;住居表示に関する法律&quot;,
a &quot;番&quot; associated with a &quot;号&quot; is issued to each building in the area.
So, usually different &quot;番-号&quot; and &quot;番地&quot; are assigned to the very same place and there may be two &quot;番-号&quot;s in a &quot;番地&quot; and V.V.

Since &quot;港区芝公園&quot; is definitely subject to &quot;住居表示&quot;, technically you cannot write &quot;5番地&quot; in place of &quot;5番&quot; for this address.
But, many native Japanese are ignorant about this distinction and there are no real-life issues brought up here.  Therefore, my argument is indeed pedantic :-)]]></description>

Also, &quot;1-5-25 (reading: いち・の・いち・の・に・じゅうご&quot;

Your middle いち should be a ご ^^]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very helpful, been wondering about this but no course book/dictionary ever goes there. Every time someone asks my address when I&#039;m in Japane I show them a card... pathetic :P

I bet the locals will be far more convinced of my good intentions if I can actually TELL them correctly where I am staying.]]></description>
