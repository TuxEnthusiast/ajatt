		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, Sanseido isn&#039;t rich in examples, just in nice, short definitions. Try Yahoo for more examples.

せい‐こう【成功】［名］スル
１ 物事を目的どおりに成し遂げること。「失敗は―の母」「新規事業が―をおさめる」「実験に―する」
２ 物事をうまく成し遂げて、社会的地位や名声などを得ること。「写真家として―する」]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll try more tomorrow - I ran out of time today, but so far it was: 成功；失敗；態度：and I think I tried 後悔.  But basically I just get like &quot;the antonym of 成功　＝　失敗；another usage of 成功 is ....this is the English...but no examples.  (At least I&#039;m reading it and I don&#039;t see anything that comes off as an example to me.)  After those four I ran out of time/wrote the comment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I went and looked it up in 4 dictionaries and didn&#039;t find it. I think the combination of it being a new/computer word, and being such a simple logical compound, makes it so that no one has bothered to define it yet. Anyway, you were right abouts its meaning. The reading is みどく, by the way,]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So, in an effort to move closer to immersion, today I switched over my gmail and google homepage to Japanese. it was pretty overwhelming, so I figured I might as well go ahead and start sentence mining... so, the first sentence i came across was &#039;スレッドを未読にしました&#039; .. pretty sweet, right? so i know it means basically something about marking the email unread (because thats what i had just managed to do).. so, i figured i would look up 未読 with Sanseido to go ahead and try to start being monolingual in my srs usage too. but it didnt have it! did i do something wrong? or did i just get really unlucky.. basically i just went and pasted in 未読 into the search box.. am i searching wrong?

but other than that, i think my first foray into a more japanese-y live is going well. or it will be, once i get the hang of  sanseido.. :) thanks for the walkthrough..]]></description>
