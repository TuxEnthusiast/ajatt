		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been accepting many things of this site, but there&#039;s one major aspect I, well, personally don&#039;t follow through on. And that, basically, is the extremeness of the immersion suggested on this site. I immerse myself plenty in most ways, I believe, but I don&#039;t really cut out anything from my old life so much. That is, I still do things very much in Dutch (my native language) and English, as well. Maybe that&#039;s because my passion isn&#039;t the Japanese language per se so much as languages in general (and among that, yes, the Japanese language is of course way ahead of any other languages momentarily). I still really enjoy other languages too, including Dutch and English. It might be so that this method will severely slow my learning process (although it really still feels like it&#039;s going very well/fast), but it&#039;s just one thing that I&#039;m not willing to let go of: my other languages. I&#039;m sure when I go to study a fourth language after Japanese, I won&#039;t want to let go of Japanese either, besides Dutch and English.

So that&#039;s one point at which I&#039;m going my own way. It might be a rather big diversion from what&#039;s being told on this site (after all, the way I do it doesn&#039;t really sound so much like it&#039;s All Japanese All the Time), but I&#039;m still getting a lot from this place. The very idea of focusing more on kanji at first came from here, as well as the improved use of my SRS (I was using a bit, but... not as much as I should have been and am now).

Anyway, I guess I want to say that I&#039;m glad to have read you, er, say (write) that it&#039;s okay to tinker a bit. Even though you did say not to tinker with the immersion bit. It still made me feel a bit better, even though I already knew theoretically I was doing it the way I wanted to do it. And I really am still immersing.

Also, I should just get off my chest that I really loved the anecdote with Sean/Shaun in the beginning of this post here. It was the finest piece of writing I&#039;ve yet discovered on this site, in my humble opinion, and I&#039;ve read tens of articles already. By the way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The way I&#039;m learning German right now was completely influenced by what you said,although the only thing left standing is the SRS, because I don&#039;t really like German music ,nor reading newspapers ,comic books, books etc. even in my native language.
I do read ,but I prefer to watch TV much more, so listening is for me the best way to repeat what I&#039;ve learnt.
One day I may even have the courage to take up on Japanese,just gathering the strength there.]]></description>
