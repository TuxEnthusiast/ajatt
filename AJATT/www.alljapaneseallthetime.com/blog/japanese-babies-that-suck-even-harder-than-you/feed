		<description><![CDATA[Yes this was indeed a confidence booster. Yesterday before work I went to the Farmer&#039;s Market near my house. There were a bunch of kids there and I saw how much they sucked at English, you never think you really sucked that much but you did more or less. While I don&#039;t have a parent to keep throwing Japanese at me every minute I have an adult brain, so I can find my own &quot;parent&quot; through vids / music / etc. and just play them all day. Keep it up everyone!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of how many times I&#039;ve failed in Japanese before there was any huge major improvement in it. You start of like a baby (Failing many times but always coming back) until you&#039;ve improved more and more until one day. You suddenly get passed the failures and success comes. Honestly and this is true for any case, you will fail millions of times and I mean millions before true success comes. This is especially true of languages.

I&#039;ve gotten passed the point of beating myself up for not being fluent in Japanese when in reality I&#039;ve become so close I can feel it.  I think one huge difference between babies and adults is that, &quot;adults&quot; are suppose to fail or do anything wrong while babies fail many times, do stuff wrong all the time but don&#039;t get criticize for it. If this was only the same with adults. But failure is apart of a success.]]></description>
