		<description><![CDATA[After reading this site for weeks (has it been months already?), I just discovered the &quot;simple-stories&quot; section.  This is awesome!

I&#039;m sure they take forever to make, but I&#039;d love to see more like this.  Or if anybody knows of any actual comics written at this level (even without English explanations), let us know.

BTW, you don&#039;t need to explain who Nakama Yukie is.  We know.  :-)]]></description>

If Tai-Kim says so then he&#039;s probably right. There&#039;s a lot that&#039;s undecided/up for argument in Japanese grammar, and a lot that I don&#039;t know. For example, the academic community is still divided over whether だ/である/で御座る have the same root or not. So...I&#039;m not really the one to ask :) , I&#039;m not an expert on it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greetings from Serbia! Good post! Hovewer, I do have one question that I know will bug me more and more as time goes by:

You mention at one point だ is the informal form of です. On the other hand, there&#039;s Tae Kim who vehemently denies this :) In his excellent guide to J. grammar he gives a clear explanation. Now, although I agree with Tae Kim, at the same time I would say that in some cases a sentence which one would want to make formal is made by simply replacing だ with です, even if it&#039;s in the past/negative/negative past. This makes it kind of hard for me (and I think I&#039;m not the only one :) to know how to exactly feel about だ and です, especially since it&#039;s an important part of everyday spoken Japanese. I know I can do the whole &quot;go with the flow&quot; approach (and I probably will :) that this and this sentence means that and that, I think it would be cool if you could offer your view on the matter.

So, what&#039;s the truth about だ and です? Is it that they are grammatically different words which sometimes simply take the same meaning (apart from the difference in politeness)?   

Thanks a lot in advance!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for making the graphics large.  While working with Heisig&#039;s information in Microsoft and SuperMemo tool, I finally decided to make the kanji extra large--48pt--and put that first in the lower box, then return it to normal size--12pt--then follow the usual procedure, putting the story from Heisig under the extra large kanji and the english key word in the top box.

An older student, with diminishing eyesight, I am much encouraged by this simple decision which has materially supported my progress.  My son has loaned the book copy of Heisig to a friend and with this large size to study, I find I can move forward with some confidence in the stroke order.]]></description>
