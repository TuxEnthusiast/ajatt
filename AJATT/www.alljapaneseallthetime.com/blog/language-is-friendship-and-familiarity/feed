		<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much for this post. I wish to share it with every language learner I know. It&#039;s so important to enjoy a language! And experience that language on a daily basis too.

I fell away from this blog for a long time, because I disagreed with some things. But I&#039;m back and reading, and your posts are interesting. I bookmarked it. I&#039;m looking forward to catching up on posts I&#039;ve missed out on. No person is completely right about anything, but you are inspiring. Without having read your blog, my Japanese wouldn&#039;t be what it is today. Even if it was as good as it is today, I&#039;m sure I wouldn&#039;t enjoy it as much. Thanks.]]></description>

Yes, the thought has crossed my mind! I have some ideas that I think would be simple yet really sweet and something people could enjoy!
The only problem is my experience in creating something like that. I have to find someone who I could either work with to produce such a program, or have someone point me in the right direction on how to do it myself.
You’re welcome to try to recreate what I’ve got. Maybe even make it better!]]></description>
