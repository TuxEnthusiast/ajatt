I&#039;ve had moments where I&#039;m using grammar/words I haven&#039;t studied consciously but I have thought abot them before and am aware of my using them. Look forward to the day when I spurt out a word without remembering where it&#039;s from. Keep tooting your own horn because it inspires me!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reminds me of the first time I used たっぷり, as in 時間がたっぷりあるから大丈夫, and then wondered where I&#039;d heard that word, and if I was using it correctly. I then heard a Japanese person using it almost exactly the same way, and then I checked the dictionary and found out I was correct in what I thought it meant. 

That was a pretty amazing feeling; unfortunately one I can&#039;t say I&#039;ve had since then. Lately when I start to use a word that I think is right just because, I lay off until I get confirmation, because I&#039;m a bit freaked out that I&#039;ll say something I don&#039;t mean to say. Didn&#039;t stop me from using 引き換える in place of 控える today, though. Oh well, you can&#039;t catch them all. :/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess I kinda know how that feels... Even though learning words like that in Japanese is still something that will remain a dream for a while... I did notice it in English a lot (Dutch is my native language)... It&#039;s weird because you use a word you know how to use, but you don&#039;t know how you know it. It still happens in Dutch as well for me though, so yeah I guess it is &#039;native learning&#039;. Well, it&#039;s cool anyway. :)]]></description>
