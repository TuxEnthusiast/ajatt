		<description><![CDATA[It’s a Mac OS X app called 発表タイマー（はっぴょうタイマー）.

Direct download: www.tuat.ac.jp/CenterStaff/Sakura/software/tuatimer/TUATimer-Release1-1.dmg

Pros: It’s free. You can set up to five timers at once. Has three different chime sounds if you want to distinguish them. And best of all, it’s in Japanese!!

Is there an alternative in English? Went to the URL above and no longer there. Msg denies me access to the server.

anyone find a seller in the USA?

SEIKO TIMEKEEPER VIB SSBJ023

		<description><![CDATA[No software is actually needed apart from what any GNU/Linux box already has.  I usually just run something like
&lt;strong&gt;sleep 3m; mplayer beepbeepbeep.mp3&lt;/strong&gt;
in the console, which in this case waits for 3 minutes (&lt;strong&gt;sleep 3m&lt;/strong&gt;) and plays back a sound (&lt;strong&gt;mplayer beepbeepbeep.mp3&lt;/strong&gt; in my case, but anything else can be done instead --- one could, for example, raise a pop-up notification, or send a signal for the application being timeboxed to terminate so you would e. g. only watch porn for 5 minutes before it closes automatically to try to manage porn addiction or something).  This is how I usually timebox my sleep (i. e. set an alarm --- then it&#039;ll be something like &lt;strong&gt;sleep 7h&lt;/strong&gt; in a quite literal sense).  If I used it regularly, I&#039;d just create a bunch of scripts like w1m, w2m, w3m etc. to efficiently run 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minute timeboxes, and then maybe bind them to some icons in whatever window manager I&#039;d happen to use at the time.
Anyway, I just got myself this Seiko SSBJ23 stopwatch and it is really neat; now I can finally measure and timebox everything in my life and not just things I do near a computer.  One thing this article forgot to mention is that it&#039;s actually water and shock resistant so it can be taken virtually anywhere.  For example, I now can timebox my shower and even sauna time where no lesser device would survive for long.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I posted this elsewhere, but… here goes again :P

It&#039;s a Mac OS X app called 発表タイマー（はっぴょうタイマー）.
Free.
Direct download: http://www.tuat.ac.jp/CenterStaff/Sakura/software/tuatimer/TUATimer-Release1-1.dmg

Pros: It&#039;s free. You can set up to five timers at once. Has three different chime sounds if you want to distinguish them. And best of all, it&#039;s in Japanese!!

Cons: 
Only for Mac, so if you don&#039;t have one, you&#039;re out of luck…there was a reference to Windows users in the app description but in all honesty I didn&#039;t quite understand ;) Well, I understood, but I couldn&#039;t be bothered into finding the &quot;さわださん作（VB版）&quot; that they ask ご利用ください&quot;.

Also, it&#039;s slightly strange in the development… i.e., Developer-san didn&#039;t bother to change the title of the window from &quot;Window&quot; and in the part of the menu bar stating the app name, it still says &quot;NewApplication,&quot; all all the menu bar items are in English, although this isn&#039;t too big of a deal since you really do NOT need the menu bar, at all. Maybe to quit, but you can always use Cmmd-Q for that.


Notes: When you set five timers, just keep in mind that they all start at the same time. Also, I don&#039;t think I quite grasped the intent of the app entirely, so after the first two timers the displays start counting up, but no problem because the other timers will sound anyway.

Enjoy! :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As Jon mentioned, Online Stopwatch (http://www.online-stopwatch.com/) is brilliant. You can set your timer, then once it ends hit &quot;reset&quot; then &quot;start&quot; -- it retains the last time you had it set to, so if you&#039;re doing a bunch of 90-second boxes, it&#039;s pretty easy to restart them. I use it all the time.

Fer anyone with a Japanese DSi and who&#039;s like me and carries it around with them wherever they go, there&#039;s an application suite of sorts (kind of a stretch to call it that, haha) on the DSiWare shop called できすぎチンクルパック (for 500 points, if I recall correctly) and it&#039;s got a timer on it. It&#039;s very simplistic, but you can set times up to 99:59, and it&#039;s fairly quick and easy to reset (not as quick as Online Stopwatch, mind you, but quick enough to be convenient when you don&#039;t have access to the internet).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[# Online Stopwatch (from website of same name)

*Pro: Free, can have multiple open at once, nice loud sound.
*Cons: Must connect to the internet one time to work.

# IPhone (standard clock)

* Pros: Can set different ring tones or create own and use your own (i.e., STOP STUDYING JAPANESE! &quot;wink&quot;), multiple alarms, 3 different types of alarm available, easy to set up.
* Cons: As Khatz said, it gets to be a hassle after awhile.

Sidenote:
My personal experience so far with time boxing is that it works well. The key for me is I need to obey my timeboxes as I can easily get caught up in a 1 hour SRS session if I don&#039;t (ignoring other important things or just not &#039;doing&#039; other things in Japanese, which is super important as well - people learn better through variety). I also find that if I &#039;obey&#039; my timer my recall is vastly better as a pay off.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HIIT Timer (Intervals) by Chris Gummer
for iPod and iPhone

I have two intervals there: 
2 minutes and also the signal when last 30 seconds are started

I use it for reading the book to prepare to an exam. I interval - 1 page of A4 format.
So I am not getting bored and too slow.

Also I have an estimated number of intervals (rounds ;)  ) for a chapter.
And I try to beat this estimate every time.

though if not ideal, but it cost me only 2 USD]]></description>
