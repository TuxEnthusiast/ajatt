I hardly know anything on this subject so yeah. ^^;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I experienced lot of trouble renting apartment to foreigners in Tokyo.
I dont want to mention their nationality but I remember a guy 
running English school in Tokyo for several years saying
 &quot;Nihongo wakarimasen(I dont understand Japanese)&quot; whenever I 
call him to pay the rent.
So the conversation was like this.
Me:I just want you to pay the rent man. Namennayo.
He:You are disturbing my private hours. I can sue you.
Me: Oh yeah? then start learning Japanese ASAP. 
He:Japanese law dont protect land lords. Youre going to lose.
Me:Heres lots of things other than laws, you will regret to learn.
I feel sorry for foreigner looking for apartment but I dont want to get 
in trouble. Its nothing racial.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Daniel: &quot;why am I being denied an opportunity to rent a place just like everyone else? ... There should be a law against this like there is in every other country that has signed international treaties on racial discrimination.&quot;

Ah, yes!  If there was a law, everything would be fine!  :/

I live in America, and I&#039;ve been apartment hunting here (in very liberal cities!) where landlords have said &quot;Sure, I&#039;ll rent to you -- the only people I don&#039;t rent to are __, even though legally we&#039;re supposed to, but I don&#039;t want them around here&quot;.  Presumably these landlords don&#039;t tell the __ this, and come up with another reason to convince them to leave.

Unless you get someone who finds out about the violation and also wants to spend the time/money to fight a legal battle over it, a law might not do much at all.  Yep, it would make Japan the land of racial harmony, like, uh, America!

I don&#039;t know what your experience with racism in America is, but I&#039;ve not actually seen anyone here be a victim of violence because of race.  It&#039;s the &quot;really annoying&quot; kind here, too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Khatz, 

With all due respect, but you ought to stick to language learnin&#039; and keep away from the social issues and perhaps maybe avoid downplaying what certain individuals have suffered by living in this country.  Maybe you&#039;re not, but it seems as though you&#039;re treating this thing frivously by the tone of your writing.  For example: &quot;There’s really nothing to complain about. I mean, what, are we babies that need everyone around us to smile and applaud whenever we expel waste&quot;.  Very cheeky, but also very condescending.  

Your perspective is off.  You&#039;re suggesting that there is racism in Japan in the way you compare its racism to other countries.  That DOES NOT suggest the non-existence of racism in Japan.  Moreover, just because certain countries are more vocal about their racism and in extreme cases more violent about it, does not suggest a gap in severity.  You should know pretty well that it is a &quot;cultural behaviour&quot; for Japanese to be reserved in their expressions, which includes racist opinions.  I&#039;ve met quite a few Japanese people who have expressed their hatred towards Chinese people--I have a buddy who lives in a complex in Kobe (a very nice one) and he tells me that very few Japanese people have acquired residence in the complex for the reason that they do not want to have Chinese people as their landlords.  Too bad for the Japanese people huh?  Cheap rent and an awesome sight from the hills overlooking the city of Kobe?  Yeah!.....well, still doesn&#039;t take away from the fact that this is straight up racism.  I have a private student (very nice guy) who, everytime we talk about economics, always has something to say about his hatred towards Chinese people.  Also, I&#039;ve seen in the classroom some students making condescending comments about Filipinos or making fun of a girl (albeit lightly) because she&#039;s half-Filipino.  I doubt Japanese people think highly of Filipinos.  I&#039;m Filipino myself and gave these children a pass because well, they are children.  I can go on and on.  Also, I&#039;ve been meeting more and more Japanese people who will not deny that Japanese society is rife with racism.  

I myself have benefitted from your advice on language lernin&#039;, to the point where some students really think I&#039;m Japanese (I don&#039;t look Filipino--I look more like I&#039;m from North Asia--China, Korea, Japan).  When I speak in Japanese, I really own it, and really &quot;become&quot; Japanese, although sometimes I can be a crude, Kansai-ben speaking one, heh.  In any case, in professional situations, and how I generally carry myself, I&#039;ve been able to prove myself to Japanese people and show them that non-Japanese Asians can be professional, classy, and forgiving.  Isn&#039;t it strange though that I have something to &quot;prove&quot; to the Japanese as a non-Japanese Asia?  I mean, it was never really a pressure back home in Toronto, why should it be a social pressure now?  

I&#039;ve been a victim of racist comments here in Japan and general 外人 discrimination in a church (of all places huh?), and I won&#039;t get into it, and I don&#039;t know how much you&#039;ve experienced racism yourself here in Japan, but for those who say &quot;stop complaining and leave the country&quot;, I think you ought to think where some of us (making amateur, social commentary on Japan) are coming from.  For some of us, the comments we make are not so much complaints, but perhaps an observation of reality.  Sure, we can &quot;complain&quot; about Japan and you can recommend us to leave the country, why don&#039;t you do the same to those who experience racism in England?  In America?  In Italy?  If people are sick of white rednecks in the south saying the N word to them, why dont you just tell them to suck it up and just leave?  I don&#039;t think Japan is such a special case that we can exclude them from cases of racism.  Japanese society of course will not bring this issue up, so I think it&#039;s important that people who have experienced racism in this country should speak out.  I personally am not gonna live in this country forever, so it is pointless for me to invest in time to topple down the whole system.  I just do work where I am called, educate the students who are not spineless that they can be honest about the deficiences in the Japanese system, and give them enough tools to make the reforms they want to see in this country.  At the same time, I am gonna benefit from this country and learn kobujutsu, learn Japanese (so I can learn kanji, better communicate with my students, read more Japanese literature, and give myself reference points and study methods to learn another language and to teach language), learn more about teaching methods, and take all my bad experiences here in Japan and turn that into a book of empowerment :D.  

No, not all 128 people are all up on your grill, and I have some very dear Japanese friends who are so far from all this racism bulls*t, but Japanese society itself is contaminated with racist elements--even my Japanese friends will not deny that.  Perhaps you yourself have some great Japanese friends, and perhaps you are vouching  for them.  That&#039;s cool, power to the people, son.  However, you need to see the bigger picture.  You have your small circle of Japanese friends,and your oba-chan that gives you free apples (I used to have that too when I was living in a small town in Hyogo.  Now I live in Osaka.  Oh how I miss free apples...and oba-chan), but these wonderful people, a wonderful exception, does not hide the racism that you complain too many gaijins complain about.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I totally agree with Khtaz at the end.  A lot of the foreigners in Japan (and from my experience I&#039;m talking about white English speakers) don&#039;t do much for Japan.  They &quot;teach&quot; English and mill about boozing and partying.  Now if that is the life style they choose to pursue, so be it.  I too enjoy partying and drinking once in a while, but I realize every action I take in public will shape the view of foreigners in my area. (I don&#039;t like in a major metropolitan area)

I think people need to see that they are ambassadors for their country and for all foreigners of their country.  If someones goes out and gives a Japanese landlord some trouble... it is almost NATURAL that they would expect the same trouble with a future foreigner.  I know many foreigners who leave Japan and don&#039;t pay bills or leave their apartment trashed... and every one of these incidents hurt EVERYONE... not just the party involved. 

For people in America.... what are the stereotypes for Chinese?  Japanese?  Hispanics? etc.. etc..

Guess what... in Japan they have a stereotype for whites, blacks, Chinese, Koreans, and the list goes on and on.  Before people start yelling racism.... why don&#039;t they try to look at it from a different perspective.  I&#039;ve hit a few walls myself, but I got what I wanted in the end... because with a little patience I was able to prove myself and improve the image of foreigners as a whole.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Most of the &quot;racsim&quot; I have seem images of from japan could be taken many different ways.  Like the sign saying &quot;Japanese only&quot;. Normally I would take that to mean the language not the race, but since people don&#039;t have the language or experience to know other wise some take it as racist.
Also the sign saying &quot;No foreigners &quot; to me means they had lots of trouble with forgivers in the past. Maybe not giving them notice of leaving or not knowing the amount to pay or what was expected of them. Basically the only way to know if someone is raciest is to talk with them with them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if anyone else knows about this, but if you&#039;re still in the states and you don&#039;t want to pay those outrageous prices for shipping from Amazon.co.jp, you can use this website: http://www.sasugabooks.com/index.php

They&#039;ve got lots of books and manga, and it&#039;s not that expensive even. And, last I remember the shipping was either very inexpensive or free for people in the states. Either way, it beats the heck out of Amazon&#039;s shipping prices. &lt;i&gt;And,&lt;/i&gt; you can even special order! So, if there&#039;s a book you want, they&#039;ll get it for you. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, there *is* a great deal of racism in Japan and at least with regard to the limits of &quot;acceptable speech&quot;, there is more than exists in the West. I&#039;m talking here about anti-Chinese sentiment (which is rife) - I&#039;ve only ever met one Japanese person who didn&#039;t profess a dislike of Chinese people and this includes several people who study Chinese...  (though I do live in one the less cosmopolitan areas of Japan...) and don&#039;t get them started on the Chinese dust! Recently I had someone telling me they blame the Chinese for their hayfever. Obviously the recent food scandals have only added grist to their mill. 
Also, try asking a Japanese person why they don&#039;t like Sumo... then imagine if you recieved a similar response in America. What would your opinion of that person be?
Whether or not this makes Japan more racist or rather, less politically correct - the fact remains that there is racism in Japan.
However, I have to agree that while racist attitudes undoubtably exist, I&#039;ve personally never experienced anything but courtesy and kindness from Japanese people and agree that foreign people living in Japan can be very  quick to see racism where none exists.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t resist leaving a comment slightly prematurely asI am at work and can&#039;t watch the video yet, so maybe I&#039;ll be back to eat my words, but from the text of the post I do feel a comment is neccessary. 

While racism/ discrimination based on race in Japan can certainly be outdown by many so called developed countries, and yeah yeah, it aint so bad here, it diesn&#039;t nean there isn&#039;t rom for improvement. Especially considering most of us reading and commenting on here are English speakers. People with an english speaking background get a free pass here to some extent, especially if you are caucasian. but spare a thought for the very real discriminatyion experienced by those from other asian nations, or anywhere lower on Japans ethnic hierarchy. As much as we shouldn&#039;t blow it out of proportion, or imagine discrimination where there isn&#039;t, we should also not accept, ignore, or deny it where it really does exist. As the dude said earlier, other countries have improved on this front, as has Japan, but only because people speak up, and do not tolerate such mentalities, in whatever extent, have they managed to move forward. Shutting up and going home is an insult to those who went before us, and fought the battles they did so we wouldnt have to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, very useful. :D

I&#039;m currently (since last night) reading an intro to Java text in French, mainly because I want to learn how to talk about programming in French, but also to brush up on Java. I took an introductory programming course more than a year ago that was mostly Java, and a game design course the following quarter that was mostly C# (which is syntactically similar to Java) but since then I&#039;ve gotten out of practice.

Anyway, I noticed that the text I&#039;m reading does not contain Hello World or any French translation thereof (I searched for &#039;hello&#039;, &#039;world&#039;, &#039;bonjour&#039;, and &#039;monde&#039;). So I&#039;m sort of wondering if that&#039;s a U.S. only or English only thing, and if there are any standard intro programs (that is, the first program you would see in an introductory text for almost any programming language) in other languages. The intro program in this text is called &#039;PremierEssai&#039; (FirstTry). It creates an integer, gives it the value of 2, and does nothing with it. Boring.

As for the topic of this entry, I remember one time I told someone I wanted to go to Japan and they informed me that it was the most misogynistic country in the world, to which I raised my eyebrows, told them that I knew it was patriarchal (like just about everywhere else) but that I doubted it was the worst. I think there are a lot of people who either idealize or demonize Japan, and both camps tend to be all too eager to convince others.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz, first time post... love your site, thank you so much!

But, I had to comment on the racism thing. I lived in Japan for about 2 years, and I did experience a few small incidents of open racism. 

http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a9/stillbornsinger/060131_220001.jpg?t=1236439882

That picture pretty much sums up my bad experiences.... There were several places I just wasn&#039;t welcome as a foreigner. I didn&#039;t really care all that much, because most of the places I couldn&#039;t get into wern&#039;t really places I wanted to go anyways. But there were several bars that would say things like. &quot;Sorry, members only&quot; or just outright だめ to any foreigners that tried to enter. (mostly buy-me-drink places, but not all, a few clubs too.) and according to my girlfriend at the time that was only foreigners they would ever say that too. 

In there defense though, this was near an American military base and I think they had a lot of bad experiences with service members (unfortunate) but that kind of killed it for everyone else. 

The other racism(?) that I experienced was more of the good type, like mentioned above. People would go out of their way to help me and make things more comfortable for me. Like for instance I stayed at a Japanese hospital for about a month, and they went out of their way to give me a fork, milk, and (nasty) bread with every meal instead of chopsticks, milk, and glorious Japanese rice. I had to keep telling the nurses to bring me what they were bringing the other patients. 

Otherwise, I felt like a rock star half the time I was over there because of the positive attention you get from the ladies... maybe it&#039;s just cause they are learning English, or because they think foreigners are cool... whatever the case it works out to the 外人&#039;s advantage more often than not.]]></description>
