		<description><![CDATA[Actually, understanding through context is very fast. Especially if you choose the right level of reading. 
-- Lemme guess.  Picture book?

When you learned how to read English, did you look up every word in the dictionary? 
-- Please stop trying to compare learning a native language to a second language.  You&#039;re an adult learning a language, not a baby/child.  You haven&#039;t lived with the language as an essential part of your life for 10-20 years.  You never went through the school system in the language you&#039;re learning.  You haven&#039;t conversed with family/friends/coworkers/strangers for thousands of hours in all sorts of contexts/on all sorts of subjects.  There is obviously no need to check everything in a dictionary over years and years of repeated exposure.  This kind of exposure will never happen for you as a second language learner and if you want to read like an adult, you don&#039;t have the time/luxury to not use a dictionary (a lot - before reaching a point of barely needing it).

1.It slows down the process.
-- Of what?  Certainly not knowledge acquisition.

4.You want to build your reading fluency, you want to learn to read at native speed.
--To build reading fluency, you have to spend a lot of time reading (obviously) and build a large reading vocabulary in the process (obviously).  A dictionary is a shortcut, not a crutch.  There&#039;s more than enough room to puzzle over the finer details of a language without adding ambiguity by being lazy about vocab, something that can be made almost entirely clear for you with a good dictionary and Google.  Reading speed increases naturally as familiarity with the material increases, not because someone practices tripping over unclear text as fast as possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I definitely agree that reading more helps. I read half of 杨红英 (Yang Hongying)&#039;s 女生日记 (Diary of a Schoolgirl) in Chinese, skipping over the words I didn&#039;t know and only stopping to look up words that continuously appeared. I haven&#039;t actually finished it yet, since I got a bit sidetracked and distracted by some other Chinese books I have. I rarely have the patience to read a book from start to finish anyway. Normally I get frustrated, but this time I just went with the flow and read as sporadically as I wanted to. It didn&#039;t really feel like I was progressing, because I didn&#039;t feel like I was learning any new words or grammar or anything.

Recently, I bought some new Chinese books. One was the Chinese translation of a children&#039;s book called Geronimo Stilton: The Curse of the Cheese Pyramid. I found that I actually understood most of the words and sentences, though I attributed that to having read the book previously in English. When I got home, though, I opened a Chinese children&#039;s book on dinosaurs. There were quite a few words that I didn&#039;t understand there, but I was surprised that I could still find a lot that I knew or could guess. Sentence structures also don&#039;t confuse me as much as they did when I picked up my first Chinese book: although I can&#039;t write sentences with more complex structures, at least now I can understand them- when they&#039;re written down, that is (speaking and listening is another matter). I haven&#039;t really done any active study, so I&#039;m assuming that my improvements are probably due to simply reading. Now I have to work on listening- perhaps I might start with my Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings DVDs that I bought in China...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, understanding through context is very fast. Especially if you choose the right level of reading. This has been my experience. You have to train your mind to do it. And when you do, the rewards are much greater. 

When you learned how to read English, did you look up every word in the dictionary? 

The reason why ER advises against dictionary use is because:

1.It slows down the process. 
2.You become dependent on the dictionary. You need to do things to make you less dependent.
3.It&#039;s a measure to see if the book is too hard for you.
4.You want to build your reading fluency, you want to learn to read at native speed.

It&#039;s a hard habit to break. I know from experience. But, just try it. Try it for a few books.

No one is stopping you from using a dictionary. :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Ken.
Not sure why all the dictionary &#039;hate&#039; in the Extensive Reading literature. Understanding from context takes a long, long time. Who wants to wait?
Instead of avoiding dictionary use entirely, just avoid it while you&#039;re actually reading. Scribble down (on a separate sheet) all the words you don&#039;t know as you read, and look them up/add them to the ol&#039; SRS later.
All of those ER studies would have shown much better results if they&#039;d done it that way, IMO.
Rather than seeing the same word 10 times before you actually get what it means (IF you get what it really, truly means...&#039;vaguely&#039; doesn&#039;t count), why not see it once or twice, look it up at your next convenient &#039;dictionary session&#039;, and then have it reinforced the next 8 times you see it?
Anyway, ReadMOD: I&#039;m in!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is great advice.  Reading is fundamental to improving language ability.  The key is not to read things that are too hard!  Read at or below your level, and read a lot.  Read things with furigana if your kanji level isn&#039;t up to par yet, or read online with the Rikaichan plugin for Firefox.

I don&#039;t agree with strictly avoiding dictionary use, since it can help to make sense of what you&#039;re reading.  Of course, if you have to use it too much, you may be at too high of a level, but looking up a few words per page isn&#039;t a problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What the tadoku challenge is about is promoting reading in a foreign language, if you have to look up some words that&#039;s okay. Don&#039;t let it stop you from reading. It is great to have graded readinger to start out with but, if you don&#039;t have access to a library of them you will run out of books that are easy enough (to not have to look up any words) before you get good enough to move on to more advanced books. Especially if we are talking the 60 pages a week Antimoon suggests he needed to reach fluency in 3 years http://www.antimoon.com/how/input-howmuch.htm

The thing about intensive reading is that the trade off to looking up every word is that as you read it gets much easier, so the amount of look ups goes down over time. When I started Harry Potter in Korean I had to look up every word, it&#039;s gotten easier over time and I can now read short passages of it without having to stop for every word in order to get the definition.

From my own experience I know that there are just some words you won&#039;t learn from context for a long long time or possibly ever. Recall that you have to look up words sometimes in your native language because the context doesn&#039;t always make it clear. So doing some look ups can actually help you progress faster. Of course the point is to make reading a part of your language learning strategy so whatever you feel comfortable with is the way to go, just want to point out that you don&#039;t have to adhere to these strict rules to participate (or make progress in your target language). And that&#039;s the point in the end is to build a reading habit you can stick with!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This should have been posted here a long time ago. There are some other rules to consider it actual extensive reading. Otherwise you might be doing intensive reading, which is also good, but much too slow and time consuming. 

Rule # 1: Read easy level books. If there are more than 3 words in the book that you don&#039;t know, pick an easier one.

Rule # 2: When you are reading, don&#039;t use a dictionary. 

Rule # 3: Skip over words you don&#039;t know. Eventually you will understand through context. Just let it go.

Rule # 4: If you don&#039;t feel like reading the book, choose a different one. Choose something you like. 

That&#039;s the gist of it. There are graded readers out there for those of you who can&#039;t quite make it reading stuff for kids. If you are in Japan you can get them easily and cheaply. I can get them cheaper here in Korea, but not all of them are published in Korea. You can also order them here: http://shop.whiterabbitjapan.com/the-complete-set-japanese-graded-readers.html#.UOjRoIlet_0 But they are a bit pricey. However you do get many many books.]]></description>
