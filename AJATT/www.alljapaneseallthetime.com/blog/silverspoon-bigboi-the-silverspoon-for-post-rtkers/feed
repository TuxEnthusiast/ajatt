		<description><![CDATA[2046?  How retro.  Seriously though, you should probably update the RTK1 Amazon links on this site so that they link to the current (6th) edition.  Aside from not covering all the new 常用漢字, the 5th edition also costs twice as much at the moment.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmm, I already did RTK1, mastered keyword -&gt; components production via RevTK site, but didn&#039;t practice handwriting and recognition is pretty weak (the &quot;only practice production and recognition will take care of itself&quot; theory didn&#039;t really pan out in my case)
 
Furthermore, I&#039;m an SS early adopter and now halfway through RTK1 via SS schedule.... of course, since I&#039;ve seen them all before it goes quite fast, and the majority of them are quickly scheduled off into the distant future thanks to the magic of SRS. But I do get structured writing practice this time, and the act of writing has really helped my recognition and &quot;completed the circle&quot;, gluing together the english / japanese / production / recognition / composite / component skills into unified &quot;knowledge&quot;.
 
So while the thought of jumping ahead 100 days appeals to me, and I am eager to get on to the next stage, I feel like it would be good for me (dangerous concept, I know!) to keep on my current path and cement the rest of the kanji (it doesn&#039;t take much time out of the day, I&#039;m mostly immersing anyway) rather than switch horses midstream.  Feel free to second-guess this decision, that&#039;s what I&#039;m paying you for.
 
I guess my other question is about &quot;Forbidden Japanese&quot; sentence packs... I assume these will be the starter J&lt;-&gt;E sentences we use when we get to the JE sentence stage, and I&#039;m assuming from-scratch silverspooners will be on pretty much the same path once we reach that stage. Will silverspooners be given access to this sentence content when the time comes??]]></description>
