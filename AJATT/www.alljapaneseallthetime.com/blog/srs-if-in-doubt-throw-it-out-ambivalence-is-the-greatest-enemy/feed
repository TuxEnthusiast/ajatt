		<description><![CDATA[Great article, I really needed to read this. I’ve realized that I’m very reluctant when it comes to deleting sentence cards in my SRS. My attitude is that if I delete a card I’ll never learn that word again. I’ll often see a boring/difficult card and think to myself “I’ll just skip it for now and deal with it later.” In other words, I’ve basically become a sentence hoarder. The results are pretty obvious though; I keep adding more cards but I’m doing less reps. Over time my deck has kept inflating to where it’s becoming too overwhelming. 
I’ve been deleting a lot of my older cards lately and I’m only adding ones that I feel are fun and relatively (but not too) simple. I assume that scoring high on reps is a lot less important than the actual amount of exposure....in other words, quantity over quality. I also think it’s important to realize that your ability to pick sentences develops with experience. That’s why it’s important to go back and weed out the older cards. Your SRS decks should evolve with your capability and interest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As for me, my reps deck has been empty for several months.  Every card I found fit to throw out and I&#039;ve yet to find one to replace it I wouldn&#039;t do the same to.  So no reps for me. :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh man, I needed to read this one today Khatz, I have been feeling so mediocre about my reps deck that it has to get pruned. It&#039;s like the dead tree on my porch right now (Bob-san was his name, before he met his tragic end). 

When did you find time to buy books yesterday? I&#039;ll have to harass you to tell me what you got :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On the contrary can&#039;t this whole &quot;delete delete delete ambivalence ambivalence ambivalence&quot; mentality be used as a band-aid fix to un-attraction to studying in general (and not lack of interest in the language) to the point that there&#039;s, like, nothing to SRS?

I think the biggest reason people dread Anki (or SRS in general) is not because they&#039;re so terrible at picking out content, but simply because SRS feels like a chore to a lot of people.]]></description>

It is so liberating that I can &#039;finally&#039; get rid of those little bastards! :D To cut a long story short: thank you for this post, it was really a great feedback for me.]]></description>
