		<description><![CDATA[@Joe

Just in case after 6 months, you come back and are still wondering...

I don&#039;t feel like going through ajatt to find the exact article(s) that say it but , if I remember correctly, during your RTK days, you&#039;re supposed to build up your Japanese ear. So it&#039;s a lot of movies, anime, songs that you just listen to without particularly trying to understand them -just building up the ear so that it learns to recognize the subtle pronunciation differences between Japanese and your native language. 

If you&#039;re watching shows/movies/anime, do it ideally without subs, but if you absolutely can&#039;t do that immediately, go ahead and put on the subs (there&#039;s quite a bunch of posts about making sure to have fun and that some is better than none, so subs &gt; giving up from being frustrated about watching something without understanding). Just remember that the kiddy gloves have to come off eventually.

As you progress through RTK (like after you&#039;ve hit a few hundred), you start &quot;reading&quot; through stuff basically just to see if you recognize anything. Once you&#039;ve hit a thousand+, you&#039;ll be able to understand a lot of keywords and might be able to piece together what sentences mean.

There&#039;s also an entry somewhere in ajatt that also reminds people that it&#039;s okay to customize. Personally I couldn&#039;t do RTK; I couldn&#039;t stand it! I HATED making mnemonics and I would 3-day monk because of it. I also disliked that I was supposed to build my vocabulary while learning kanji, when I knew that nothing excited me more than seeing a kanji I just learned pop up somewhere I was reading.

So I changed it up and did lazy kanji for all the joyo kanji WHILE doing sentence SRS (I wasn&#039;t a big fan of MCDs either so I chose the 10k sentences method).

Is it what ajatt normally recommends? Nope. Is it customized to make my learning experience fit me? Sure was. My japanese progressed quickly, far quicker than my 3+ years of previous textbook-learning japanese ever did for me, and I wasn&#039;t burning out. In the end, ajatt has always been about having the most japanese you can handle, if that means you have to customize, then do that - whatever keeps you learning!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Reading manga, watching TV and movies, listening to music in Japanese, right? Talking once you were able…being affected by trends in speech.&quot;

I keep reading stuff like this on the site. People complaining about RTK anki reps and stuff like that. And then theres always advice like above following. My question is how are you supposed to follow the advice above when:

A. Your still doing RTK and havent learned the japanese meanings 
B. You dont know any vocab, grammar or japanese meaning behind Kanji because you have not yet done J-E sentences. So you cannot physcially read anything. The only thing you can do is pronounce the sounds of the kana that appears, but you wont understand it at all. And any kanji that appears you can just say its english meaing in your head. Movies is just alien dribble to you at this point.

Ive been learning RTK atm, and in reality I havent learned any Japanese this way, I just know what pictographic symbols mean in english. Every show I watch in japanese, I dont understand because I have never learned the vocabulary.

Is this how the learning is supposed to be? Until you finish RTK and start sentences your basically learning nothing but RTK english meanings, and just learning how words that you dont understand, sound and are pronounced via immersion?]]></description>

I learned to code by trial and error, but Joe Wright of http://www.joewright.org/ actually taught people to program using &quot;input&quot;, i.e. learn to understand code first. I think this is actually really important, because a lot of programmers (arguably most pros) spend as much if not more time reading code as actually writing it.

&gt;Putting in examples of segments of code? 
Yeah, that sounds right. And asking yourself what they do. Not in a vague way but in very specific ways. What is the value of foo...that type of thing. I&#039;m sure you can think of cooler, more interesting questions.

Perhaps a mixed input/trial-error approach would be ベスト.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah O.K. thanks! 

I am a newbie to programming besides some dabbling in C++ in the past, how would you recommend inputing a programming language in an SRS? Putting in examples of segments of code? However I do think that trial and error is alright in programming, no? Because you can get a right/wrong response from the compiler immediately?]]></description>

Forgive me! You have not been forgotten. Um...yeah, I did buy Japanese books for PHP. NO single book was like suuper gold book to end all books, but then I guess almost no book ever is. The all had their strengths and weaknesses. I generally picked books that had good indexing and interesting, well-commented code examples. If I had to do it all over again, I would simply recommend to you the highest-rated books on Amazon.jp (I found my books at my local bookstore since I was in a rush or something [must have PHP boox NOW!], but if I were to do it all over again, I would buy highly-rated books from Amazon).

With that in mind:

I also recommend using the Internets. Just limit www.google.jp to 日本語 pages.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz...I&#039;ve heard you say time and time again how important attitude is. And you&#039;re right. There is definitely an energy right in my chest that feels like turmoil when I can&#039;t seem to study, and feels like I&#039;m swinging on the swings when I&#039;m in the studying mood. I haven&#039;t figured out out to control it yet, but it&#039;s there for sure.

I have my suspicions that food and diet have something to do with it. Have you any thoughts on how your diet has affected your moods? If you can come up with a Khaztumoto-diet I will try it out. Dancing to the Kanji? Yes, I will buy that, too. Lol...]]></description>

I&#039;ve been trying for days and I still can&#039;t get the deal about と言う,って orて when it comes to quoting/describing etc (and 家庭教師 ヒットマン リボーン is full of it! :( ).]]></description>
