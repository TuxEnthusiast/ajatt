		<description><![CDATA[Taleb says: &quot;You can focus your reputation or your actions but not both.&quot;
...and: &quot;It is as difficult to avoid bugging others with advice on how to exercise and other health matters as it is to stick to an exercise schedule.&quot;
...and most importantly: &quot;There are two types of people: those who try to win and those who try to win arguments. They are never the same.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Sadly I also told people about the SRS (How stupid was I) now there is more competition for higher class rank.
 
There is no competition with others, there is only competition with the enemy within :)
 
lol but yeah, I know what you mean. Back in high school, I once showed a friend of mind named B-Dawg a cool Photoshop technique I came up with. He then showed a bunch of other people, and they were all like, &quot;Omg! You&#039;re amazing, B-Dawg! [fake name :P]&quot;, and even the teacher was like, &quot;Wow B-Dawg, great job figuring that out, you get bonus marks!&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[The Buddhist in me suggests that advice should be freely given because even if people don&#039;t appreciate it now, they just might someday.  Speaking as one who is pretty thick-headed, I know this to be true. :-)

You don&#039;t hit them over the head with it, but naturally you don&#039;t want to withhold it either. That defeats the purpose of generosity.

Look up the Four Bodhisattva Vows sometime on Google if curious.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A friend, once told me to do this with my programming and tech know-how. I was of the type that just HELPED everyone out, and funny, soon as I started telling people that I would bill them for my time, the calls and annoyance stopped, almost instantaneously. And I love it that way.

Good advice is definitely worth sharing, but one should choose the recipients well... very well. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Personally I like to think that if the advice is &quot;worth its weight in gold&quot; then it is worth letting everyone know. 
Indeed it is true that &quot;Truly good advice should be like a truly good stock tip &lt;a title=&quot;Here we go again with the stock similes…&quot; href=&quot;the-righteousness-of-selfishness#note-7231-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;: it should work whether or not other people agree with you on it; it should work whether or not forum trolls and IRL trolls know about it and cosign on it&quot; and that&#039;s why I believe worthy advice is worth telling - even if they don&#039;t agree with it, it can still help them. Even if their ego refuses to accept it, it can still positively affect them.
It doesn&#039;t have to be that the provider needs to tell people, but that the receiver needs to hear it.  ]]></description>
