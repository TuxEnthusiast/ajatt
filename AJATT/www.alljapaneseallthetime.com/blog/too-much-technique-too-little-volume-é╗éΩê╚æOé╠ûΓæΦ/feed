		<description><![CDATA[You see this with other languages as well, not so much the phenomenon you see with Japanese about people not wanting to use children&#039;s media like cartoons and what-not (most people, I&#039;ve found, really like the idea of using that stuff for Spanish since it&#039;s simple and fun), but what you DO see are people who constantly think they&#039;re &quot;not quite ready yet&quot; to start talking to people, especially native speakers, in Spanish (or whatever).
Look, they are gonna KNOW that you&#039;re not a native speaker, there&#039;s no getting around it, and...look, when you&#039;re listening to someone who&#039;s native language isn&#039;t English speak English, are you or are you not generally inclined to cut them a LOT of slack when it comes to their command of the language? Exactly, the fact that they&#039;ve managed to get where they are, wherever that is, alone is impressive enough and deserving of congratulations.  Speakers of other languages (except maybe Parisians with regards to French) will all have the same attitude towards you when you try to talk to them.
This goes doubly so for English speakers, and TRIPLY so if for American English-speakers, because English-speakers in general and Americans in particular are the last people in the world known for their foreign language skills, so when a Spanish-speaker or Japanese person or whatever meets an English speaker (yes they can tell by your accent and, probably, by how you look), particularly an American, who speaks ANY of their language, they&#039;re generally impressed and flattered.
Dude, no one&#039;s going to call you stupid or incompetent just because you don&#039;t have a perfect, native-level command of their language (except maybe the French and only in Paris--but, to be fair, the rest of France hates the Parisians as much as anybody else, it&#039;s kind of the national sport there).
START TALKING TO PEOPLE.  No, it won&#039;t hurt anything, plus it&#039;s easy and free to do from home thanks to the plethora of language exchanges available online now and the fact that English is the most popular second language in the world right now (meaning everybody wants to learn it) which means that YOU&#039;LL have no trouble finding someone willing to talk to you in their language in exchange for you talking to them in English for the same amount of time (that&#039;s how language exchanges work).
Cheers,
Andrew]]></description>
