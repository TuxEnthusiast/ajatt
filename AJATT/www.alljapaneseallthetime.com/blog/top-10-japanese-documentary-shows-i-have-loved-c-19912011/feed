		<description><![CDATA[Khatz, another worthy addition to your media recommendations would be your top 10 favourite Japanese movies! 

Anime has been the backbone of my immersion environment since the beginning, but after seeing the movie Fujoshi Kanojo, I&#039;ve gotten the urge to put my inner Otaku aside for a while, and bring forth the Movie Critic within! (Ironic, if you&#039;ve seen the movie :P)

Recommendations from other AJATTeers are also welcome too! :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very cool! I MUST find some equivalents in Spanish!  I believe there was one called &quot;The Take&quot; about unions in Argentina that was in Spanish with English subtitles that got really popular within the last couple years, that would be a good start...

		<description><![CDATA[For you would-be (or existing) Remember the Kanji folks, I started a new video series called &quot;Bite Size Kanji&quot; on my youtube channel.  Might be worth a look if you a) are considering the James Heisig method, or b) if you want to review.  I&#039;ll keep the vids coming as long as there is interest.

		<description><![CDATA[I think this sort of post is what we need more of - a broadening of horizons, very practical information over simple maxims.

I mean, maxims are great, don&#039;t get me wrong, but hard information is undeniably useful. Kudos.

ps When I first watched 地上の星&#039;s PV, I wondered, &#039;man what in the world am I watching,&#039; because it was the only Japanese video I&#039;d seen that had no Japanese people in it. Except the singer. It&#039;s quite a lovely song.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;a steady stream of unfunny, low-budget “variety” shows that show an increasing lack of variety [Oh, I&#039;m not bitter...]
If there&#039;s anything in this world you&#039;d be 100% justified in being bitter about, it&#039;s this. Because &lt;i&gt;I sure am&lt;/i&gt;.

Anyway, these sound pretty tight. I&#039;ve already pulled up an episode of 知らないニッポンのウラ to watch. I&#039;ve a hard time with TV keeping my attention, so hopefully these&#039;ll be interesting enough, haha. Thanks for this list, brah.]]></description>
