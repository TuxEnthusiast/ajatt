		<description><![CDATA[I grew up in Tokyo, and then moved back to teach English in Skizuoka-ken in my twenties. I had certain assumptions, as all foreigners do when they first move there. I loved Japan, and since I&#039;d grown up with the culture, I expected to integrate easily. Sure, I looked different, and my Japanese would sound different, but I would be able to eventually find my place.

I think one of the main reasons why expats don&#039;t learn the language is that after awhile, foreigners realize that no matter how much they bend themselves into a pretzel, they will never fit in. Sure, some will date or even marry Nihongin, but they are quirky oddities: the funny gaijin, the genius who actually knows how to use chopsticks, any caricature or personae the Japanese can create in order to place gaijin into their comfortable definitions of what a gaijin should be.

It&#039;s human nature to want to fit in, and in a homogeneous society where &quot;the nail that sticks up gets hammered down,&quot; it can be psychologically devastating to realize that you will, in fact, never fit in. Not really. I&#039;d imagine that on a subconscious level expats refuse to learn the language as a way of saying &quot;F-- you&quot; to that cultural mentality.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this wonderful article, Khatz. However, you say to not spend one or two hours practicing Japanese. I&#039;m confused though. What does practice in this case constitute. I just started, and I&#039;m learning kana before kanji. I&#039;ve got 20 kanji down, and I have my schedule down to 10 new kanji a day with ample review time. There&#039;s not much I can do with that, but I&#039;m listening to Japanese music and talk radio and podcasts practically ALL day even in my sleep, on top of watching J-drama. Right now I can&#039;t think of any other ways to practice the Japanese I CURRENTLY know short of playing my copy of Ore no Ryouri that I&#039;ve been playing. Please accentuate on what you mean here?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Having taken Japanese classes in Japan, my experience was actually that most of the teachers are very very enthusiastic and sweet, but are just terrible teachers. They have little training and little practice and you&#039;re better off doing it at home apart from one thing- the Nihongo &quot;cafes&quot; many of them offer- for a small fee one can show up and speak only Japanese with other learners in a low pressure environment, about the topic of the week. That, my friends, was worthwhile... because I met other foreign researchers, and I got to practice my nihongo without the panic that comes with talking to native speakers in Japan (for me- but I panic talking to people in general due to being very shy.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[you really have hit the nail on the head in so many ways. I&#039;ve been studying Japanese for a long time now, in high school, in university, and I spent a year at a Japanese university and I decided to try out the teaching english/living in Japan thing, but so many people, in both of those situations, as you said, create this enclave for themselves. Its insane. There are, however, plenty of opportunities to get yourself out of that, though.

The other thing that I&#039;m happy you touched on was the nihonjin-ron. So many of my Japanese teachers (and textbooks!) have been condescending about foreigners learning Japanese. People and materials that are not positive or supportive are in no way creating a suitable environment for a language learner. 

thanks for a great post!]]></description>

It would, if and only iff you have them CORRECT you mercilessly. Tell them, the smallest mistake, awkward pronunciation must be pointed out, even (if they&#039;re cruel people) ridiculed mercilessly. And if you find yourself making too many mistakes, then an input-heavy silent period may be in order. I had to take one of those at one point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Khatz,
I have a Japanese roommate and two Japanese conversation partners (none of whom I speak to in Japanese intensively).  I&#039;m not that advanced in my speaking, hence the reason we don&#039;t speak in Japanese that often. I&#039;m wondering if it would be good to talk to them in Japanese or if it would damage my skills...I&#039;ve been studying for 4 years, but am just now getting &quot;good&quot; at speaking....

		<description><![CDATA[About No. 5, learning the Kanji, I was wondering if there is any other order apart from the village idiot order and the Heisig method in which to learn the kanji best. Is there any material online?

I currently use the village idiot order, as all of my learning material use it. Blargh
But I don&#039;t want to use the Heisig method, since I developed my own method to recognize components and memorize them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yep, you&#039;re absolutey right about this.

&quot;1. Bad Company&quot;

This one was interesting - I read recently on the BBC website (quoting an American scientific study) that researchers have recently concluded in that study that by far the most important reason that otherwise very talented/intelligent people do not fulfill their potential is the influence of (a less talented/intelligent/ambitious) peer group. Sadly, in spite of a bit of a dig on the BBC webiste (news.bbc.co.uk), I can&#039;t find the story now, but interesting nonetheless.

So, lesson to us all - don&#039;t hang out with losers - that&#039;s people who want to endlessly debate the pros and cons of the various bl**dy useless conventional methods of learning Japanese in this case...

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;And anything you really can’t do (like go to government offices), your bilingual Japanese girlfriend can help you with.&quot; Haha, this I love :D

My boyfriend&#039;s dad has been living in Japan for the last 15 years or so and barely speaks a lick of Japanese, but he&#039;s married to a Japanese woman so he doesn&#039;t have very many problems. He&#039;s totally fluent at ordering beer, though, as that&#039;s the one thing his wife won&#039;t do for him]]></description>
