		<description><![CDATA[Love Sowell (in a platonic way). I will read that too. Also, George Gilder&#039;s Knowledge &amp; Power, in which he maintains that Capitalism is an INFORMATION system not an INCENTIVE system. The language application for that would be, I suppose, that free markets are messy, with lots of changes, adjustments, failed experiments and &quot;unapproved&quot; innovations that deviate from experts&#039; &amp; leaders&#039; prescriptions.  It&#039;s bottom-up, not top-down.

That&#039;s why I love Khatz&#039; approach, by the way. He has enough influence and power to seize the language-learning throne, declare himself king, and tell us exactly what to do, but he keeps refusing it, like George Washington, or (Shakespeare&#039;s) Julius Caesar.]]></description>
