		<description><![CDATA[Hi khatzumoto! Thank you for your blog. It is inspiring, no doubts. 

A technical question regarding the SRS software. Can you address the source of flashcards with kanji&#039;s? I understand that there are resources of kanji&#039;s on the net, no matter commercial or for free. Am I right? 
I do not believe that in order to use SRS I have to enter each kanji into the software. Could you advice on that please? Can anyone help withthis access?

Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Khatzumoto! 

Well before everything, a HUGE thank you is the least I can say, especially if you know that I tried billions of sites or/and techniques to learn japanese, and linguistic immersion happens to be the most simple, yet, the most effective. I don&#039;t really know if you have already been asked this question, nor if there is an answer for it somewhere in the site. But when it comes to learning kanji, which of those orders would be the best to follow:
Learning kanji by key, or strarting from the most simple to the most complicated, or starting from the most used words, or learning the kanji of every new word I learned? The last would probably be the best, but your confirmation is always welcome! 
P.S: I actually randomly learn them, which means: I learn the easiest from the new words I learn.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatzumoto,

Thanks a lot for this site, I&#039;ve discovered it a few days ago, and although I&#039;m studying Chinese (Mandarin), it&#039;s really helpful, with a few changes here and there because of the differences between Japanese/Chinese of course.

Although I know you&#039;ve said a few times that it doesn&#039;t matter which SRS you use, as long as you use one, I am still wondering if you could write how Khatzumemo compares to Anki (and Mnemosyne).

I was first using Mnemosyne, but now I also want to use SRS on other PCs and on my phone, so I was searching for an alternative, which brought me to Anki.
Which looks really cool and all with the nice interface and all extra options.. but many extra options always make me wonder if it&#039;s making up for something if you know what I mean. I like simple things. So maybe KhatzuMemo is the good middle way to go?

I saw in one of the articles that you&#039;ve started using Anki to study Cantonese because you can use audio files, have you totally switched to Anki? or are you using it next to KhatzuMemo?
Maybe some pros and cons between Anki/KhatzuMemo would be nice to read.

Thanks a alot for your time :)

		<description><![CDATA[Haha, I used to hate writing out characters over and over again, which was what I was encouraged to do during Chinese school. I still do, at least when it&#039;s doing the same character 320948230594242395 times in one sitting/day/week. But when I started learning Chinese again (note that these are traditional characters since my mom is from Taiwan... she always says that &quot;simplified chinese is not real Chinese!&quot;) I started to actually like practicing writing them. What I used to do was just learn to recognize them, maybe write it a few times for my memory. Now when I learn a new character, I get out the good old writing sheets and repeat it throughout the day until I&#039;m satisfied with my handwriting. Just so I don&#039;t forget it, I then write that character out on every whiteboard in the house every week or so. I just love showing off mah skillz, yeah? :P But I definitely agree with not getting a cramp from writing the same character for like... hours... and then expect to have it in your memory.]]></description>

Now when I learn a new character, I get out the good old writing sheets and repeat it throughout the day until I&#8217;m satisfied with my handwriting. Just so I don&#8217;t forget it, I then write that character out on every whiteboard in the house every week or so. I just love showing off mah skillz, yeah? <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />  But I definitely agree with not getting a cramp from writing the same character for like&#8230; hours&#8230; and then expect to have it in your memory.</p>
