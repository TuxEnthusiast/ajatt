Also not sure what your operating system is, but while getting your OS into japanese can be a hassle enabling japanese just requires downloading some software called an IME.   Google has a decent one, http://www.google.co.jp/intl/ja/ime/ and microsoft has a good one you can add in through the control panel under the keyboard tab in the region and language menu.]]></description>

But sometimes the kanji is part of a picture or something and I can&#039;t do that... And these are usually kanji that I have no idea how to pronounce or type or anything. Any tips?]]></description>
