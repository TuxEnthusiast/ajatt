		<description><![CDATA[I learned French entirely with word lists. I really like it, and find it way better than Anki because I can drill the words over and over. I never get enough exposure with Anki. Once I know a word fairly well from my word lists, only then do I bother adding it to Anki.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s kinda how I use them now... pick up a list (any list! (just make sure it&#039;s Japanese!)) and abuse it!  pick a few unknown words (just the pretty ones), take them on a date, show them around, get to know them a little better. And then just trow the the f*** out! Really, who does she thinks she is, that dirty list!

See, I don&#039;t even make SRS cards anymore. It&#039;s just not my style I guess, it bores me, makes it feel like work, makes me feel bad when I can&#039;t get that one card right! The words will stick in the end, you&#039;ll come across them again. And if not, who cares? Really, not that important now, are you &quot;word&quot;! Anyway, reading books is what I love, I just do it in Japanese now. (Kindle paperwhite has a dictionary build in so you can just tap a word to see the definition, pretty awesome, my best learning tool to date)

Only Kanji, keep repping kanji, can&#039;t do that without an SRS... but 5 minutes a day of reps is not so bad. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah memories of taking the train home from work, dog tired, trying to memorise row after row of German verbs with their English translation underneath. Wechseln, verwechseln, abwechseln... how I ever imagined I would then be able to use these accurately and in context really baffles me. 

The trick I use now works much better. When out and about I run a monologue in my head where I try to describe things I see, think of what I&#039;d say in certain situations etc. I keep a list of ‘unknowns’ on my phone which I work through whenever I&#039;m at a computer with time to spare. I look up the correct phrase and force search this in google to find examples, creating anything from 1 to a handful of MCD cards depending on the number of decent sentences I find. 

The advantage of this is that the sentences tend to contain other words and usages previously unbeknown to me. I can then create MCDs for these too, using examples that contain the word I was originally looking for. This leads to a sort of force-multiplier effect, whereby I learn the phraseology around a certain idea as well as the word itself.  

For example  I recently looked up the word for direct debit (Abbuchung), which lead me to people complaining that their bank statement (Kontoauszug) listed debits they weren’t able to account for (konnte diese nicht zuordnen). Just doing this for a handful of new words quickly proliferates into whole chunks of overlapping knowledge, all nested in neat sentences ready to be put into the SRS.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The only problem I face with ordered word lists is that it becomes an empty, rote experience. Sure, word lists ensure I learn. But they also ensure I become bored as I learn. I then associate Japanese words with said boredom. I then forget said words. I then try to relearn these words. I become saddened by my lack of progress, and begin to feel a gnawing uncertainty of when I will finish said word list. I then lose my desire to learn Japanese. Of course, for those that have an uncanny ability to review consistently and daily, I&#039;d say go for it. My own experience, albeit anecdotal, tells me that if one requires excitement, interest, or stimulation to learn; he must learn individual words through excitement, interest, or stimulation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Especially at the beginning of my Japanese adventure there was something that I did a lot and I think it&#039;s quite amusing (at least for me). 
1.I searched a sentence that had interested me. 
2. I put it in Anki. 
3. I took one word of this sentence and googled for examples (Sentences from 知恵袋、２ちゃん, tatoeba etc.)
4. I took the new sentence with the one word that I already knew. 
5. Repeat it until you don&#039;t enjoy it anymore. 

The big advantage that I saw, was, that I had one word in two different sentences. And it was somehow funny to see how different the sentences became after a certain time.]]></description>
