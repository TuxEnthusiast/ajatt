		<description><![CDATA[&quot;(Also, sometimes you have ideas that are “in-process”, and you don’t want to share them before they’ve reached maturity, because people’s idle comments can be unnecessarily distracting, and threaten the open-mindedness and patience that is necessary in experiments on one’s life — a good deal of what I’m doing falls into this category).&quot;

This is exactly how I feel. It seems that anyone who wants to be better must hide some of their conscious efforts to do that. That is to avoid &quot;realistic&quot; comments and discouraging from others. 
The &quot;secret&quot; is that when you decide something and you are ready to stay with it , everything else becomes more or less trivial and you are entitled to success.When you succeed, everyone is thrilled to congratulate you but before almost everyone is either cynical, idle, non-supportive or ironic.

I have read a lot from Steve Pavlina, Tony Robbins and Napoleon Hill and you can always see that great people always have something in their imagination which pushes them through the tough time.

Thank you Khatz for this post and long live Personal development.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I’ve always considered your site to be a “Personal Development” site above a language learning site because the truth is, you’re not teaching me ‘jack’ about Japanese :-P (but telling me all the juicy tips on where/how to get such a noble edjumucation)

Anyway, I just wanted to ask about the fast-food link. I didn’t get what you were getting at, because there is no mention of fecal matter or dying children pristine white or otherwise. It seems like a bad attempt to criticize honest, hard-working individuals who found a better way to do business successfully and *gasp* honestly by using a personal brand of ‘personal development’ we could probably learn from. (At one point, the author seemed disgusted that a honest businessman was not ASHAMED of being so successful.. because what, PROPER success is guilt-laden?) Is that why you linked? I’m just completely lost on the connection…]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@事理
&quot;Like you said “delete boring cards or they will delete you” What if your subject is so mundane that it constantly deletes you!? Does any one know?&quot;

That happens to me alot of the times. Like when i first starting collecting cards+sentences i was all about massive amounts of sentences. Even if it didn&#039;t interested me at the time. But I think the problem is that not what needs to be learned, but what needs to be enjoyed in order to learn. For me nowadays i can pretty much enjoy any type of things, even if it&#039;s boring(In Japanese). Basically now i&#039;ve started collecting sentenes from sites like amazon.jp, youtube,jp, anything reliable japanese sites nowadays. I think khatz is refering to that if you don&#039;t enjoy the cards you&#039;ll eventually quit all together. So always keep the interests up. I know when i&#039;m in school that like i want to learn more japanese even while in classes lol. But using the SRS for both japanese and school can save so much time for both. So that&#039;ll lead to more time for japanese enjoyment. If the subject is sooo boring beyond words, i&#039;d say delete it. But ppl might argue that what if it&#039;s something that needs to be leanred? But you find it so boring? I&#039;d say you&#039;ll eventually learn it b/c it&#039;s part of the language itself, such things like dates, numbers, idioms,etc,etc. So main thing here is. Enjoy,enjoy,enjoy because if you&#039;re enjoying anything in japanese, you&#039;ll most likely want to learn anything in japanese.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am surprised you even finished school judging by the fact that, you know that school is corrupt.  Its really hard to always focus on school since Japanese is way more interesting and can eat up time. I read some self help Memory books to cut my study time, will WSSK even make a difference. Like you said &quot;delete boring cards or they will delete you&quot;  What if your subject is so mundane that it constantly deletes you!?  Does any one know?]]></description>

I did stop at the jokes though. Damn funny writing.

I&#039;d say 99.9% of personal development is full of crap because that&#039;s a great number.

It&#039;s that .1% that makes a big difference though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Personal development eh? That&#039;s definitely vital for language learning and life in general. But yea i haven&#039;t read any of those books in ages. But since learning Japanese via AJATT method, there&#039;s a definitely a change in attitude towards language learning itself. I&#039;ve always assumed languages would are hard to learn and generally would take years to get to an &quot;intermediate level&quot; of the language. But after reading this awesome site my opinion changed drastically about this subject. So gave me great insight in learning languages, especially others aside from Japanese. Such as mandarin Chinese and Cantonese. Those were oringially the languages i wanted to learn, but i got hooked into japanese, so i&#039;m going all the way first with japanese then go onto mandarin then cantonese. Sounds like alot of languages eh? Likely i&#039;ll know already like 3100+ kanji which they all share in common. That already takes like 3-4 months off in doing kanji only for those languages. But definitely there won&#039;t be anything wrong in re-checking up on the kanji from the book &quot;Remebering the Hanzi&quot;. Definitely there&#039;s a good reason to invest in personal development as there is a definite link to learning languages. Damnnn so much reviews for my sentences. 1605 reviews. Managed to get half of that done straight. Since school is finished, definite time for more sentences+AJATT. Keep up the good work on khatzmoto-sama, dono, san, kun? Whichever you prefer lol.]]></description>
