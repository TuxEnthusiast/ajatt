		<description><![CDATA[Heh, I like to think I have advantage in learning languages, as I have all day.  Thing is, I have maybe 20% more time for Japanese than those who work normal jobs do here in America.

I&#039;ve been at this for about a year, probably found out about immersion and this site at around April.  Had my ups and downs as well.

You know what shocks me?  I thought my progress was slow(I have Autism) despite the time I&#039;m putting in.  However, I go to any Japanese learning site and find out many people there aren&#039;t close to where I am, even with the same or more time put in.

It gets better too.  I see some of these people on Twitch too.  For example, I asked someone who finished watching Code Geass, and they said that Japanese was too hard and used English subtitles.  

Many people there who say they are learning hate anime too and probably spend half(or more) their time NOT doing/listening to things in Japanese.  Also, sometimes they link to learning methods that are likely VERY boring.

Point is this:  Such people think that something fun is not how you get better, when it&#039;s the only way to sustain it.]]></description>

Forcing myself to DO work, definitely never ever seems to work. Your article pointed me in another direction. Maybe I should start thinking that I don&#039;t have ALL that time in the world, except that would stress me out (but that is another issue to manage).

This is the first time I stumbled upon your website. You&#039;ve got good articles and you write in an interesting way. Cheers!]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was just brooding about this exact same problem last night and wondering how I could go about it. What are the chances that I would stumble upon an article talking about the very same issue that kept me awake all night, lol.</p>
<p>Forcing myself to DO work, definitely never ever seems to work. Your article pointed me in another direction. Maybe I should start thinking that I don&#8217;t have ALL that time in the world, except that would stress me out (but that is another issue to manage).</p>

		<description><![CDATA[@Luke

I&#039;m in the same situation as you, roughly. I started studying French about seven years ago and I can say a lot of things (hold a conversation about almost any topic), and understand most things, both spoken and written. I can even write with a fair bit of detail. But I make tons of errors of gender, misusing certain expressions, spelling, occasionally conjugation...

Right now I&#039;m just trying to read and watch/listen to a lot of French. I&#039;m hoping that eventually I will start to get the kind of instincts that lots of listening from early on are starting to give me in Japanese. But I&#039;ve only been doing this briefly, so I don&#039;t know what the long-term effects will be, except that I already read faster and with more enjoyment than before. And that I think I&#039;m picking up some kind of Canadian accent a little bit (French Canadian internet radio...).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, that is *exactly* my problem! I knew others had similar ones, but I always thought mine was the absolute worst. Nice to hear others on here think the same way. Thanks so much!]]></description>
