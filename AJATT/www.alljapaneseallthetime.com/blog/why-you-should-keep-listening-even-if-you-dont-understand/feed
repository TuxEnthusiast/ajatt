		<description><![CDATA[Khatz this is a success story based on the above &quot;vodoo&quot;. Ive only been studying japanese hardcore for a year or more,  maybe a few more months, and the progress I&#039;ve made continues to shock me and give me extreme pleasure, deeply learning a language has changed my life for the better in so many ways. Im not at the point of fluency now but i can express endless ideas and can understand maybe 60 percent of what i hear in only a year, and many times more then that, it just depends on the material. The point is I noticed the greatest gains when i put this listening into practice after only  few months i realied soemthing was happening, The language was no longer a jumble of sounds, i didnt know what they were saying but i knew when words all began stopped and sentence structure was being burned into my long term memory as well as words since i was hearing them over and over.

Now, when this was paired with 2 hours reading a day(some days 30 some days 1 hour, ) i realized the staggering power of this method, the ajjat way(I know you don&#039;t likes it to be set in stone).
I am now enjoying Japanese video games, drama(that&#039;s a lot harder at times but ultimately such fun)..and even translating Japanese experiences of people who have had experiences im interested in and then comparing them to western experiences!!

only 6 months ago i could get through a 1 a4 page fairy tale in around 2 hours of immense struggle, now im breezing through them and reading blog posts almost fluently, the only thing that stops me in my tracks in words i haven&#039;t heard. Its extremely rare now i come across a grammar structure or sentences structure that gets me, meanings its usually very rare..

And again, i have to agree and somewhat vindicate you when you talk about (and this is genius) not talking first and how it will simply come trough exposure, it really really does, im online now talking on skeyp to Japanese people and the might have to correct me twice in a  conversation  and they are always shocked at my vocab etc etc...i never EVER practiced talking it just happened, wow thanks khatz let me just tell you all, it can and does work! read, listening, have fun, do your sentences, and enjoy your life in Japanese, but most of all, take it slow and be consistent, the payoff(and im no where near where i want, but now i can clearly see it) is beyond amazing, 

P.S not being employed for a year has obviously helped haha, ive been able to truly dedicate my days to Japanese,  I have even been recently asked by a radio haost to give him my translations of Japaneses near death experiences so that he can compare them to english!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know that this is true because well, this is how I learned English. I am fluent (at least I&#039;d like to think I am XD)
and have people asking me where I was from, thinking I&#039;d say I was American. I&#039;m not, I&#039;d say. I am Arabic. How did you learn?

T.V. + Music + Reading.

This all added up to a near perfect grasp of the language, so much that when my English grammar teachers would ask why do we use this form instead of that, I&#039;d reply &quot;Because it sounds right.&quot; Later on, I learned all the semantics and stuff, but I always knew the answer.
Don&#039;t worry if you don&#039;t comprehend stuff, because you&#039;re mind retains them, and you&#039;ll eventually understand without knowing when or how you even knew. You just do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ha! I was listening to one of my TESOL teachers talk about this and was like, &quot;Oh, that&#039;s why I can speak more Japanese than my friends who are taking a class.&quot; I learned more spoken Japanese from watching subtitled anime/toku than spoken French from a year&#039;s worth of classes. Go figure.

(In case you&#039;re wondering, I started investing in movies with French language tracks and listening to French pop artists and am on my way to being able to converse at the level I can read, which, admittedly, is up there [I can read academic abstracts and understand about half of the papers they&#039;re attached to], so my French teacher did something right in the three years I was in her class.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you Daniel, but I think passive listening (even if you&#039;re not paying attention) is better than nothing if you don&#039;t have much time.

		<description><![CDATA[I think a balance of extensive and intensive (and comprehensible) input is the most important thing you can do for your language study. I think it is important to spend at least half of your input time listening, and relistening, to &#039;comprehensible&#039; material, Krashen +1 style, looking up new words as you go. Extensive listening, or listening to a range of material that is kind of above your level, is indispensable for getting used to the rhythm of the language. In any language, lack of rhythm will make you sound seriously off. I&#039;m studying Chinese, and the benefit of extensive listening, even when you don&#039;t understand, is two-fold - you also get a good grounding of tones and how they fit together. You will naturally start to use native-like tone variations in different combinations etc, and will be way more accurate in general. 

Great article! I&#039;ve got to think of writing my own article about this over on my own blog, I feel I have quite a bit to add!]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think a balance of extensive and intensive (and comprehensible) input is the most important thing you can do for your language study. I think it is important to spend at least half of your input time listening, and relistening, to &#8216;comprehensible&#8217; material, Krashen +1 style, looking up new words as you go. Extensive listening, or listening to a range of material that is kind of above your level, is indispensable for getting used to the rhythm of the language. In any language, lack of rhythm will make you sound seriously off. I&#8217;m studying Chinese, and the benefit of extensive listening, even when you don&#8217;t understand, is two-fold &#8211; you also get a good grounding of tones and how they fit together. You will naturally start to use native-like tone variations in different combinations etc, and will be way more accurate in general. </p>
<p>Great article! I&#8217;ve got to think of writing my own article about this over on my own blog, I feel I have quite a bit to add!</p>
