		<description><![CDATA[with ditzy girls with names like “Kimberley”. . .gee thanks. *insulted*
Anyways. . .
I&#039;m sad, sad because I knew all along that I have to sacrifice tihngs I love beyond my own understanding to get to the place I&#039;m gonna get to. You just made it even more obvious, and real.
But acknowledgement is the first step. The rest comes afterwards.
(sudden urge to eat water chestnuts)
The people that are closest to me are on opposite ends of the scale on this.
On one hand, a person who knows equal exchange and therefore sacrifices a lot of time with family to be with friends and a lot of time with those friends to play videogames (true passion)
On the other a person who wants to do everything right and true and preferably all at once too.(imagine how much that person gets done in a day. . .not much)
So i know the joy of doing what you want to, and the sadness of the people you give up to do that.
You can&#039;t jump to one trapeze without letting go of the other but damn if most of us don&#039;t try to anyways.
Ah, all the things I&#039;m gonna miss. . .]]></description>
