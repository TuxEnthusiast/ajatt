「千と千尋の神隠し」も良い作品だったけど同じ年に公開された「クレヨンしんちゃん　嵐を呼ぶ　モーレツ！大人帝国の逆襲」がその年の No.1 だよ。
その年のと言うよりも過去のあらゆる日本アニメ映画の中で堂々の No.1 だと思ってる。
TV の「しんちゃん」とは全然違うから（大人向き）機会があったら、と言うか今すぐ TSUTAYA へ走って借りてきて観てくれ！
一緒に「嵐を呼ぶ　アッパレ！戦国大合戦」も借りてね。

The only Japanese voice on the TextAloud program I can find is Kyoko.  I downloaded her voice but I&#039;m kind of dissapointed!  She sound very robotic and seems to skip or something, does anyone else have her voice?  Does anyone know where to find a better one or edit Kyoko&#039;s settings to make it work better?]]></description>

Also note that just like the English names, the Japanese names are based on modified forms of real words. Pikachuu comes from pikapika which means glittering or giving off a bright light, i.e. a zap of electricty and chuu which is a mouse&#039;s squeak. Waninoko comes from wani which means crocodile and ko which means child etc. 

They could serves as good mnemonics, and it&#039;s always interesting to have one of those eureka moments when you learn a new word: &quot;Mudkip... ah it has the word mud in, now I know where its name come from!&quot; Hehe. :-)]]></description>

Obviously not too beneficial in terms of grammar/usage, but beneficial in the sense that it&#039;s fun and it&#039;s in Japanese (which happen to be the core principles of the AJATT method).

Assuming that you&#039;re a fan of Pokemon (and I maintain that anyone from my generation who ISN&#039;T is just lying to themselves), then one of your many reasons for learning Japanese might be to communicate with, and/or understand the nerdy chatter of, Japanese Pokemon fans. To that end, that project would have immense practical value as well (roughly 500 vocabulary terms you didn&#039;t know before!) And if nothing else, it&#039;ll provide metric craploads of katakana practice.

I realized for the first time the other day that they are probably different (and they are), and it seems fun to learn!  But, I don&#039;t know if it would even make sense to learn (are they real words or hybrids like &quot;Squirtle&quot;?)  Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OMGosh, I was just reading over this, and...okay, I was just reading the kana and trying to recognize as many keywords as I could for the kanji (basically sucking, lol...).  But, out of the whole thing, I recognized one thing.  SHAKESPEARE.  I swear I saw that in katakana.  That is sooo awesome.  Like, I&#039;m planning to be an english major, right? (this is going to be an obvious obstacle in my study of Japanese....) And I&#039;m in a shakespeare class right now.  I&#039;m a flipping FANGIRL.  OMGOSH.  Okay, I&#039;m sorry.  I just had to get that out of my system.  
Anyways, I have no idea what context you used it in, but I think that&#039;s cool anyways.  BTW, that brings me to another question.  Everybody knows the Japanese are obsessed with learning English.  But what about English Literature?  Like, do they study English literature (like Shakespeare)?  And if so, I think that would be an awesome job; teaching Shakespeare at like a University in Japan or something.  *starts to hyperventilate*  okay, I really have to stop now.  You totally don&#039;t even have to respond to this post.  This is just be being a stupid fangirl----
okay I&#039;m done for real.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OMGosh, I was just reading over this, and&#8230;okay, I was just reading the kana and trying to recognize as many keywords as I could for the kanji (basically sucking, lol&#8230;).  But, out of the whole thing, I recognized one thing.  SHAKESPEARE.  I swear I saw that in katakana.  That is sooo awesome.  Like, I&#8217;m planning to be an english major, right? (this is going to be an obvious obstacle in my study of Japanese&#8230;.) And I&#8217;m in a shakespeare class right now.  I&#8217;m a flipping FANGIRL.  OMGOSH.  Okay, I&#8217;m sorry.

I&#039;ll try to answer. There are two main types of Japanese classical literature: 漢文 and 古文/文語。漢文 is basically Literary Chinese with little marks on it to tell you how to turn it into Japanese. Reading 漢文 basically requires you to know as much 漢字 as in Mandarin/Cantonese; roughly 4500 at least. On top of that you need to learn how to interpret the little marks.

古文 on the other hand is the language of the 平家物語 and 源氏物語, and several other works. The grammar is based on Japanese of the 10th century but there are &quot;modernisms&quot; depending on the date of the work; it is thus quite different from modern Japanese, you cannot read a 文語 text if you know only the modern language. The kanji set for 文語 is quite limited, roughly the same as 現代日本語 but you might have to know the traditional characters　(旧字体 ) depending on the publisher. The spelling using the kanas was also not stable as pronunciation had changed a great deal since they were first written (the modern orthography and pronunciation was devised during the 明治時代). 

I saw a great IMO grammar book for Classical Japanese at the library I frequent. It&#039;s called &quot;The Grammar of Classical Japanese Prose&quot; or something by Alexander Vovin. Being a descriptive grammar, it contains a whole lot of sample sentences to illustrate various grammar samples and the linguistic terminological subtext helps a great deal in transferring the sentences to an SRS.]]></description>
