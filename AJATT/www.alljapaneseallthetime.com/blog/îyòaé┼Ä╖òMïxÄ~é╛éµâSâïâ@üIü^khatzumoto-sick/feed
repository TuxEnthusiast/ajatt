		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Igor: Keyholetv is very addictive + it must be the only broadcast program that works with my low internet connection...

AJATT is SO ADDICTIVE! can&#039;t get enough. I discovered this website on a wednesday 2 weeks ago and on the sunday I was at 100 kanji (in fact104!). I&#039;ve been in raw immersion since something like 1 year and a half without even knowing what the word meant ^^; listening to a lot of (obscure) punk jazz rock bands, watching interviews, etc...
I needed something, a motivation to start learning the language. I&#039;m glad I found it by chance. (Tokyosam vid on youtube...)
today I&#039;m at about 350 kanji, I keep my good Heisig pace and really, this website achieved to convince me...it became obvious, it was the thing to do right now.

thanks Khatz
get well soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha.  I&#039;ve been doing the same thing.  Everyday, I probably check twice when I get on my computer &quot;just in case.&quot;  Lol, I should probably be doing something in Japanese.  That&#039;ll probably help the withdrawal symptoms...I can&#039;t really blame Khatz, though.  If you&#039;re sick, you&#039;re sick.  I wouldn&#039;t want to have to deal with whole bunch of fangirls (like myself) on the Interet, lol...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@ Diego:
Go, Diego, Go!  Jk...
Um, for music, I would try jmp3.net.  It&#039;s free, and there aren&#039;t any obnoxious torrents or any other stupid things to sign up for, just direct download.  I would recommend: Orange Range, Shaka Labbits, Aqua Timez, Namie Amuro, and maybe...yeah, you should just check out Khatz&#039; page of music recommendations.  But basically, that site&#039;s awesome.
As for anime, I&#039;m not sure where you can download raw anime.  I think you could do like torrents or something, but I obviously have no idea what I&#039;m talking about there, lol, so... Anime that I have on DVD I watch without subs (unless I have them with Japanese subs, but even then...).  I know Khatz recommends watching things ALWAYS WITHOUT subs, but I&#039;ve  found it to be not that detrimental.  In fact, I&#039;ve picked up a few words that I hear often but just haven&#039;t quite made the connection on my own just yet.  Anyways, I probably won&#039;t do this once I start sentence mining.  As for doing stuff explicitly in Japanese, I&#039;d say shows with english subs until you finish kanji and start sentences is fair game (as long as you don&#039;t get obsessed with subs), and I would probably hold off on only Japanese only pages till you&#039;ve done kanji.  Don&#039;t get me wrong, I &quot;read&quot; them often to test my kanji recognition, but, other than that, I don&#039;t think I&#039;d ever get anything done, lol...Then again, maybe you should just stay away from surfing the net at all until you can start doing it (with meaning) in Japanese.  This&#039;ll minimize english surfing time, and you&#039;ll have more time for other things like anime and dramas (and Densha Otoko...)  BTW.  Don&#039;t watch the anime of death note.  please.  Just read the manga or watch the movie(s).  The show is pitiful.  You&#039;ll just hurt yourself, and you&#039;ll never like the series as much as you would otherwise, lol...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hope you get well soon Khatzumoto!

As a side note, I just started my Kanji on Monday and I&#039;m doing 20 kanji a day. I&#039;ve currently done 100 kanji so I think I&#039;m moving at a good enough pace. I&#039;ve put a couple of Japanese songs onto my Ipod yet I can&#039;t get the amount I want. Can anybody suggest a page where I can get a lot of japanese music without a lot of difficulty? By using limewire I am gaining nothing so I need a more effective method. Also, any links to where I can find raw anime such as Death Note, Samurai Champloo, Air Gear, etc.? 

I would appreciate any help I could get on these things since I really need to Japanize my environment more cause it&#039;s still too English oriented.

Oh and one last question, since I&#039;m only a beginner should I still be watching shows or trying to browse Japanese pages even though I don&#039;t understand anything? Or should I wait until I understand more Kanji and then Japanize my environment to its full potential?

Any help on these questions will be deeply appreciated. That&#039;s all for now.

Once again get well soon Khatzumoto!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[About doing what you enjoy in English.

I like Douglas Hofstadter, Neal Stephenson, Raymond Kurzweil, Enders Game, personal finance books -achieving financial independence aspirational type trashy books :D, articles about programming techniques - particular high level stuff, futurists, indie computer game development, interesting science, AI, robots, pretty typography and general writing about aesthetics, writing and character development for novels, hearing how people created cool things such as books, games etc. 

Given that stuff does anyone fancy giving me a few links or names to things I might find interesting! Thank you :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chuck F, avoid English like the devil past the beginner&#039;s stage. True, you should be going toward what you enjoy (Japanese grammar books are totally ok, as long as you enjoy them), but really, staying in English textbook Japanese is not going to get you too far. 庭三郎(にわさぶろう)&#039;s grammar guide (google it) is very good from what I&#039;ve heard.

And that&#039;s really a big part of AJATT. Do what you enjoy in English in Japanese.

Also, grammar is not what teaches you the language (or doesn&#039;t), it&#039;s the amount of exposure. Based on my experience, the constant exposure will give you deeper insights into the workings of the language (that and a monolingual dictionary =]) than any grammar book in English could.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I wish I could look up when I started the kanji, since I assume they would make up a good portion of the time.&quot;
I meant kana :/
I should really get into the habit of reading what I post more.
